      "these projects resulted in a body of experience and design rules-ofthumb which the author and collaborators are seeking to capture by the methods described in section 4. it is to be understood that peptides proposed as b-epitopes for the construction of synthetic peptides rarely work well alone recall that immunogenicity is the ability of a particular substance to provoke an immune response in the body and that an epitope or antigenic determinant is the small part of an antigen that is recognized and distinguished by the immune system specifically by antibodies b cells or t cells .\n",

      "it is also required for programming functional adaptive immune responses and therefore coordinates the entire host immune response to infection .\n",
      "this may be due to several causes including an alternative approach to achieve prolonged loss of the vector especially if present in an episom-transgene expression is to use artificial chromosome al form transcriptional silencing of the transgene vectors or integrating viruses since they are stable promoter loss of the transfected cell through cell over time and will propagate to daughter cells should turnover or the generation of an immune response to cell division occur.\n",
