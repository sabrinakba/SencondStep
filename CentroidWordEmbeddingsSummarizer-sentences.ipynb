      "in broad terms the immune system among vertebrates is similar especially in regard to immune responses to virus infections. thus an immune response is mounted. alternatively an immune response might only be produced to one of them. the fish immune responses are also subject to greater environmental modulation than mammalian responses. but if the consequence of administration of such compounds is the augmentation of host responses to virus infection then the precise classification of these compounds as ifn inducers or immune enhancers as well as their detailed mechanisms of action are of secondary importance 9 8. immune modulators immune modulators are substances which either stimulate or suppress one or more elements of the immune system. some years ago it seemed reasonable to teach students of virology that there were essentially two components of the immune responses namely the humoral b-lymphocyte responses and the cell mediated t-lymphocyte immune responses. it is clear that many viruses cause suppression of immune responses. it is convenient to divide the immune system into several categories. any element of the immune system must be viewed as part of a homeostatic system and therefore a perturbation of any one element is bound to affect the entire system to some degree. immunity is usually active in that one or more of the viral antigens elicit immune responses. the purpose of the succeeding discussion is to highlight the responses to virus infection in domestic species on the ground that full understanding of the interplay between viruses and the immune system is essential in order to design the most efficient and practical antiviral measures. more details about these responses will be given in section 5. in the present context it is sufficient to point out that the consequence of virus infection is largely influenced by the immune responses.a defect of the innate immune system more particularly the complement system is the inciting culprit. the infection has also occurred in newborns with apparently normal immune systems. pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia can be seen in infants with apparently normal immune systems. the pharmacia unicap system was studied. igg2 subclass plays a vital role in the immune response to polysaccharide antigen. immune system investigation showed elevated ige 5320 and igg 979 . factors affecting thymic function impact the ability of the body to reconstitute the immune system. progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml is a disorder of the nervous system that affects individuals with immune suppression. the common immunologic defect in patients with cvid is defective antibody formation and many different immune system defects have been reported in this group of patients. protease-containing allergen prescribing patterns have not significantly changed from young stage of life is a crucial period for aeroallergen sensitization considering the immaturity of the neonatal immune system which may lead to t-cell anergy or a deviation towards th2-type response in mice. the spectrum of the clinical presentations of nk cell deficiency is not known since it is not normally included in immune system evaluations. histamine is known to influence immune response by regulating cytokine synthesis allergy 47:024-1992 .also in these patients cortisol correlates to lactate and ehsp90 but in contrast to sirs the ihsp72 and ihsp90 immune response is depressed. extracorporeal methods of immune modulation have shown promise for treatment of sepsis however achieving an appropriate response is a major challenge . we investigated the impact of sepsis on the adaptive immune system and to monitor t-cell receptor tcr diversity. with the aim to improve the results of treatment we studied the eff ect of inhalable nitric oxide on the immune system in newborns with respiratory diseases on mechanical ventilation . responses were received between august and november 2013. we had 77 responses. currently there are fi ve commercially available cerebral nirs systems. our aim was to describe the immune phenotype in human aki. there were no adverse cardiovascular responses to either position. recent reports suggest that losartan inhibits t-helper th -1 immune response and ultimately attenuates infl ammation in several angiotensin ii-mediated infl ammatory diseases . co gedv and evlw were measured by the two systems. introduction sepsis is associated with immune hyporesponsiveness but the immunological processes behind this are ill defi ned. regarding evlw there was no signifi cant correlation between two systems.cysteine c should be avoided perhaps replaced by serine s not least because of the formation of unwanted cys-cys s-s disulfide bonds although at either end of the peptide a cys c already present or added can provide the link to a carrier protein that is essential for b immune system antibody response and t system memory. concerns are for raising antibodies b immune system implanting immune system memory in the case of vaccines and specificity and avoiding unwanted cross reactions with other proteins with similar epitopes to the target protein of interest. some authors use the term more specifically for analogues that are not dependent on an immune response but act as an antagonist to in this case binding or cleavage. these projects resulted in a body of experience and design rules-ofthumb which the author and collaborators are seeking to capture by the methods described in section 4. it is to be understood that peptides proposed as b-epitopes for the construction of synthetic peptides rarely work well alone recall that immunogenicity is the ability of a particular substance to provoke an immune response in the body and that an epitope or antigenic determinant is the small part of an antigen that is recognized and distinguished by the immune system specifically by antibodies b cells or t cells . it is parts of the surface of a virus that normally interacts with the host cells for entry and which are vulnerable to the host immune system. although the dehydrogenase is a very different model system to any directly relating to 2019-ncov there were some interesting observations regarding emodin binding that might be extensible to more relevant simulations in a manner consistent with the above target refutation principle . also while b epitopes from exposed regions of a pathogen are key to the antibody response t epitopes from anywhere in the pathogen proteins may be needed for t-system memory and cellular responses and the overall structure may benefit from linkage to molecular adjuvants such as muramyl dipeptide and possibly to other stimulating and anti-suppressor peptides. this is after ref identified these viruses as closely related to 2019-ncov. thus by analogy it is a putative antagonist for 2019-ncov entry. as the situation appears at this time major simulation studies in this project will be delayed until an experimental structure of the 2019-ncov spike protein is forthcoming which at current rate of research on 2019-ncov will doubtless be soon. the system used to explore 2019-ncov to host cell binding activation and cell entry i e the binding model was chosen on the basis of inhibitors common to or similar between a sars binding activation and entry and b and ligands including inhibitors of an enzyme of medical importance as discussed here below. in the letter case it might require an additional peptide as a t-epitope for immune system memory which might come from anywhere in the s protein or even elsewhere in virus and perhaps other agents such as molecular adjuvant.although heat stress may boost the immune system above its normal level the result would not be noticeably protective if virions are dormant and therefore invisible to the immune system. an interesting and ingenious recent review looked directly at the seasonality of immune responses in humans by investigating antibody responses following vaccination . the authors commented that this may indicate that viral rna remained in the respiratory tract without being internalized and eliciting an immune response . influenza viruses have been detected several times in the absence of symptoms or an immune response in the host which seems to indicate that dormant influenza virus is present. however the good blood flow to the respiratory tract that is associated with heat stress allows the activated virions to be destroyed by the immune system. it is often assumed that an evolutionary arms race exists between viruses and the host immune system with each making a series of small improvements to gain an advantage over the other . the other four major epidemics listed above were in midwinter when according to this view the immune system should be at its weakest suggesting that the virus should spread and the epidemic should continue for more than eight weeks. for example the immune systems of hosts may frequently be activated by certain dominant viruses during the winter months reducing the likelihood of subsequent infection by less active strains. if we are going to say that the increase in varis in the cold season is due to the increased susceptibility of hosts in cold weather m3 it is difficult to explain why the human immune system appears to be less efficient in early autumn than in say february. however the authors do not tells us what proportion of volunteers were chilled by breathing cold air and what proportion by wearing scant clothing breathing cold air while remaining warm can be protective presumably because viruses are activated but they can be removed by the immune system. although the authors found seasonal variation in immunity it could not explain vari seasonality: seven of the studies of vaccines reviewed reported a stronger immune response in winter than in summer with only 1 showing the opposite trend. can we believe that the islanders immune systems could cope well with a regular 6°c drop but succumbed after a 7 5°c drop note that the absolute temperature after the dipabout 23°c at night -was still very comfortable and would certainly not cause a vari epidemic in say helsinki.they help to initiate the innate immune response and mediate signalling between the innate and the adaptive immune system. the respiratory innate immune system comprises both cellular and non-cellular components which limit the spread of any invading pathogens within the lung and activate the adaptive immune response to mount a specific response. individual respiratory viruses will activate various components of the innate immune system in a variety of ways and many have evolved mechanisms to hide or utilize the host response to prolong survival. both cellular and non-cellular components of the innate immune system are activated in bronchiolitis and psrw. many cytokines with both pro-and anti-inflammatory roles are produced by all cells of the innate immune system. however there was little change in adaptive immune responses or long-term outcome 49 alveolar macrophage effects are specifically caused when the rsv f protein binds to macrophages via toll-like receptor 4 tlr-4 50 tlr-4 as part of the universal pattern recognition system is found on all mammalian cells although the exact interaction between rsv and tlrs has not been clarified for all cell types. the pathogenesis of both bronchiolitis and psrw is not fully understood but it is clear that the innate immune response plays an important role in limiting viral infections. they also have an immune suppressor effect in both the innate and adaptive immune responses to dampen down excess inflammation. defects in some components of the innate immune system have been shown to be associated with the development of more severe disease or the host s inability to clear the respiratory virus. why some infants are severely affected requiring admission to hospital whilst others experience a simple cold is not fully understood: research has suggested that the innate immune response to these viruses is important. monocytes express the integrin b3 receptor which is important for monocyte migration adhesion and signalling an early step in the innate immune response to respiratory viruses. it also activates neutrophils and nk cells 3. deficiencies in tlrs spa and d and il-8 role in the innate immune system have been shown to be associated with severe rsv disease 4. rhinovirus is a common cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract illness especially psrw: 30% of all infants under 3 years experience at least one episode of wheezing 5. rhinovirus has been shown to infect both airway epithelial cells and macrophages leading to their activation and differences in innate immune response have been shown between infants who develop asthma and those who are nonatopic 6. deficiencies in cytokine production at birth are associated with subsequent risk of wheezing 7. in the long term there is an increased risk of recurrent wheezing post rsv bronchiolitis.the introduction: neutrophil extracellular traps nets are one of the immune systems to suppress dissemination of infection by the netted chromatin decorated with antibacterial molecules. there were 55 responses giving a response rate of 39 6 %. results: we received 190 responses response rate 66 % . a similar response was observed in three other animals. pamps cause either direct damage or trigger an immune response in the host to fight infection leading to the production of high levels of cytokines and the release of damps into the bloodstream which can trigger a maladaptive systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs that can contribute to organ injury. methods: 1384 patients admitted were reviewed over cis metavision imdsoft in bakirkoy dr.sadi konuk.an early warning was protocolized in the system relevant to international guidelines.septic shock alert was activated if the condition as per = 2 systemic inflamatory response syndrome sirs criteria together with sbp 90 mmhg was established.patients were categorized into 3 based on intervals between first alert activation and initial response as per orders for diagnostics and interventions. introduction: c1 inhibitor c1inh belonging to the superfamily of serin protease inhibitors regulates not only complement system but also plasma kallikrein-kinin system fibrinolytic system and coagulation system. a positive response was defined as an increase of 10 % from baseline. results: the response rate was 136 89 % from 153 residents. all blood samples were analyzed using the eaa system. responses were anonymously collecting using internet-based survey software. all pts were monitored with cpcco pulsion medical systems and serial tee have been performed.the type of immune response to hrsv is a major factor in the development of wheezing and asthma exacerbations. immune response to naturally acquired hrsv is poor and developing an effective vaccine faces the challenge of improving over the natural infection to elicit a balanced immune response including th1/th2 cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and hopefully hrsv-neutralizing antibodies including secretory iga. cell-mediated immune response is central to recovery from infection and immunosuppressed patients are at risk of severe hrsv disease and fatal outcome. a long-lived t-cell immune response develops in most infected immunocompetent persons and is responsible not only for recovery from infection but also for tissue pathologic changes. symptomatic reinfections are possible despite the presence of antibodies suggesting rapidly waning immune response or circulation of closely related but antigenically different viruses. t-cell immune response is involved in the clearance of virus and immunocompromised hosts may develop progressive and even lethal disease. it is known that sars-cov nsp1 protein increases cellular rna degradation and thus might facilitate sars-cov replication or block immune responses. the virus evades innate immune response defenses interferes with interferon production degrades cell mrnas and modulates ubiquitination pathway. in addition to the host immune response factors inherent to the virus may be central for pathogenicity such as the varying susceptibility of the hpiv f protein to cleavage by proteolytic enzymes present in infected tissues. the effect of sars-cov infection on the immune system is highlighted by pronounced t-cell lymphopenia and elevation of several inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 and chemokines mcp-1 and ip-10 observed in patients. a deviation toward th2 cytokine response is associated with more severe disease whereas a th1 response leads to effective viral clearance and milder illness. hrsv infection of epithelial cells triggers the release of th1 cytokines ifn- il-2 il-12 th2 cytokines il-4 il-5 il-6 il-10 ifn- ifn- and chemokines that amplify the immune response and inflammatory reaction.mhv and neurotropic mhv-jhm in particular or variants thereof has served extensively as a model for the study of host immune responses to the virus during acute and persistent infection of the central nervous system. both cellular and humoral arms of the acquired immune response are important in controlling mhv disease and recovery from infection. the full manifestations of acute mhv infection are usually interrupted by immune response or death in infants. organ specificity of b and t cells in host immune response to infection appears to also occur with enterotropic mhv. a number of studies have documented significant effects on immune responses of mhv-infected mice through both direct and indirect effects of the virus reviewed in barthold 1986 lindsey et al 1991 . in mice with disruption of the jhd locus absence of b cells and ig and syngeneic h-2d b cell-positive antibody-deficient mice it was found that the absence of b cells or antibody had no effect upon cd4 + or cd8 + t cell responses or virus clearance during acute mhv-jhm infection of the central nervous system . in addition viremic dissemination to the central nervous system is often seen in infant mice barthold and smith 1984 and immune-deficient strains of mice such as nude scid or rag null mutant mice figs 6-4 6-5 . conflicting results have been found with central nervous system infection with mhv-a59 in cd8 + t cell-deficient beta2 microglobulin null mutant mice which were able to clear acute central nervous system infection in most mice sutherland et al 1997 . thus caution is advised in generalizing about pathogenesis and host responses to mhv which are likely to be both virus and mouse strain-specific. mhv infection of the central nervous system represents a commonly used model system and mhv-jhm remains the most frequently utilized neurotropic strain for such studies. splenic t cell proliferative responses were depressed in mhv-jhm infected balb/cbyj a/jcr c3h/hesnj but not c57bl/6ncr mice . such results must be interpreted cautiously as b celldeficient b6.igh6 tmlcgm mice have impaired t cell responses to mhv-jhm .vaccination pathways are important in inducing efficient immune responses and different immunization routes may elicit different immune responses to the same protein antigens. s1 subunit for example is much shorter than the full-length s protein but it is no less able to induce strong immune responses and/or protection against viral infection adney et al 2019 . despite their ability to induce immune responses and/or neutralizing antibodies ntd and s2 as the targets of subunit vaccines are less immunogenic eliciting significantly lower antibody titers cellular immune responses and/or protection than the other regions such as full-length s1 and rbd jiaming et al 2017 . similarly some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity causing some harmful immune responses. similar to dna or vlp-based vaccines subunit vaccines are generally safe without causing potential harmful immune responses making them promising vaccine candidates. adjuvants play an essential role in enhancing host immune responses to mers-cov subunit vaccines including those based on the rbd and different adjuvants can promote host immune responses to variant levels lan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 . currently the structure of 2019-ncov rbd and/or its binding with the viral receptor has not yet been available. the accessory proteins interact with host cells potentially helping the viruses to evade the immune system and increase their virulence menachery et al 2017 . particularly effective and safe vaccines are urgently needed to prevent and control the current outbreak of 2019-ncov. currently the newly identified 2019-ncov is spreading to infect people resulting in significant global concerns. therefore more studies are needed to elucidate the potential for the development of mers-cov full-length s-based subunit vaccines including understanding their protective efficacy and identifying possible harmful immune responses. a recombinant sars-cov rbd rbd-293t protein expressed in mammalian cell system was able to induce stronger neutralizing antibody response than those expressed in insect cells rbd-sf9 and e coli rbd-ec du et al 2009b suggesting that rbd purified from mammalian cells has preference for further development due to its ability to maintain native conformation.deps related to the immune response were identified between resistant and non-resistant strains after bmnpv infection. as above all the deps related to the immune response might play an important role in response to bmnpv infection in digestive juice. here four deps including spn-1 spn-2 spn-16 and prp are known to be related to the immune response were identified. thus the immune response plays an important role in the defense against pathogens . after removing the genetic background and individual immune stress response proteins we identified nine deps likely to be involved in response to bmnpv infection. pathogen-associated molecular patterns are pathogen molecules recognized by cells of the innate immune system by pattern recognition receptors prrs . melanization is a major immune responses against large pathogens or parasites in arthropods and phenoloxidase po is a key enzyme in the melanization process . in total four deps involved in the immune response were identified belonging to either the prophenoloxidase ppo pathway or having pattern recognition receptor functions table 2 . serine protease sp is a class of proteolytic enzymes with serine activity centers that play an important role in digestion growth development and immune response in insects . peptides carbohydrates and lipids that are absorbed by epithelial cells and enter the circulatory system . additionally four sps were identified that were potentially related to resistance to bmnpv in digestive juice by removing those deps related to either genetic background a35-vs p50- and individual immune stress response proteins p50+ vs p50- . these results indicated that spn-2 may be involved in the b mori antiviral response.multiple sars-cov proteins have been reported to interact with components of the innate immune system to evade an antiviral interferon response and these are discussed below with the individual proteins that have been implicated in this process. innate immune responses are detectable within the first few days postinfection followed by the development of an adaptive immune response bergmann et al 2006 savarin and bergmann 2008 . the adaptive immune response to mhv-3 differs between susceptible and resistant mouse strains. about 40% of these noncoding rnas are similarly regulated during in vitro infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with mouse-adapted influenza virus and by interferon treatment suggesting that these noncoding rnas may play a role in regulating the host response to virus infection particularly the innate immune response. microarray data suggested dysregulation of t-cell and macrophage differentiation with a th2-biased immune response and a profibrotic environment within the lung zornetzer et al 2010 . c3h/hej mice exhibit an intermediate pattern of resistance/susceptibility developing chronic pulmonary fibrosis and bronchial hyperplasia with 40% of the mice dying by day 28. mhv-1 replicated in all mouse strains regardless of susceptibility to disease suggesting that the development of pneumonitis was a result of the host immune responses. we briefly review the various reverse genetic systems that are available for the different coronaviruses. various strains from this group provide model systems for diseases of several organ systems. in addition antibody responses to mhv-3 were undetectable in balb/c mice up to death at 5 days postinfection in contrast to a/j mice that began to mount a robust antibody response by that time levy et al 1984 . like jhm.sd infection of the cns high virulence is associated with an inability to induce a robust t-cell response. both systems allow relatively facile genetic manipulation of mhv-a59. this is particularly true in regard to illuminating the functions of viral proteins that interact with host proteins that are part of the host response to infection.fc receptors have been shown to be important regulators of immune responses . the failure of fipv infected cats to mount an effective initial immune response has been attributed to the inhibition of th1 cell-mediated and enhancement of th2 antibody immune responses. a th2 type immune response to infection with s mansoni is associated with its persistence and soluble carbohydrate egg antigens can cause a switch towards a th2-cell-mediated immune response . delayed-type hypersensitivity responses can be elicited in the palpebral mucosa or skin with fipv antigen in immune cats. this observation may be significant as many viruses have evolved mechanisms to interfere with antigen presentation to mhc i molecules as a strategy to evade the immune system . recognition of a foreign invasion and in this case by an rna virus is the essential first step in the initiation of an immune and/ or inflammatory response. it is therefore important to study how fipv infected macrophages respond to infection because they also mediate the resultant immune/inflammatory responses. mhc class ii molecules enhance tlr mediated innate immune responses and a failure to increase mhc class ii molecules may have a suppressing effect on innate immune responses . pbmc or whole blood cultures from fipv immune cats proliferate in response to live virus exposure in vitro and produce ifnγ in response to t cell epitopes of the viral n protein . this misuse of dc-sign is thought to circumvent antigen processing or alter tlrmediated signaling and skew immune responses towards th2 rather than th1 . an imbalance in t cell versus b cell immune responses by macrophages during the earliest stages of infection has been evoked as one reason for the inability of certain cats to resist fip. mycobacteria may also target dc-sign to suppress dc function and modulate immune responses .patients with resolved viral infection will develop a polyclonal antibody immune response to different viral antigens of 2019-ncov. alternatively if one were to use the homologous rbd from 2019-ncov itself this immune response would likely be very advantageous since it could yield both a blocking effect and a vaccination effect 52 . regarding the sars rbd strategy the body would likely develop an immune response to the sars protein eventually although the key intervention period of infection to combat 2019-ncov would fall under this window of time where after an immune response for both viruses would develop. moreover there is also the human immune response against foreign immunoglobulins to other species which would potentially complicate any treatment scenarios 22 . there were no specific antiviral treatments for sars or ebola at the time of the outbreaks beyond supportive measures 10 11 which is a similar situation that healthcare systems are facing with 2019-ncov. the mers rbd-fc fusion demonstrated the ability to block viral infection toward cell receptors as well as to stimulate an immune response against that specific viral domain in mice 47 . in order to use ace2 as a therapy to treat patients it would be advisable to convert soluble ace2 into an immunoadhesin format fused to an immunoglobulin fc domain ace2-fc thereby extending the lifespan of the circulating molecule while also recruiting effector functions of the immune system against the virus. this may facilitate faster activation of the host antiviral immune response and elimination of the virus which was illustrated in a sars mouse model where fc engaging antibodies were more potent in eliminating sars via activation of phagocytic cells compared to antibodies that neutralized virus alone 64 . a phase i trial demonstrated rhace2 was well tolerated with no effects seen on the cardiovascular system 60 . while hiv and 2019-ncov are very different viruses with different cell types kinetics and clinical courses the previous results with hiv are encouraging that this could be a therapeutic strategy for 2019-ncov. there is also the potential for the equivalent rbd of 2019-ncov to be produced and used as a therapy as well. different human fc domains igg1 igg2 igg3 or igg4 could be contemplated although igg1 traditionally has the most potency for triggering anti-microbial responses 49 .though the exact outcome of plpro s deisgylating activity during viral infection is currently unknown isg15 is an important activator of the immune response. moreover k63-based chains have been shown to be key components of the innate immune response as they mediate protein complex formation . another well characterized ub modification the k63-based chain is commonly associated with regulating endocytic processes the dna-damage response and innate immune response pathways . though the exact cellular targets for these accessory activities are unknown plpro has been directly linked to suppressing interferon-b ifnb production by the innate immune response during virus infection . the second function is to remove ubiquitin and isg15 proteins from host cell proteins which likely helps coronaviruses short circuit the host s innate immune response. identifying targets for antiviral therapies and viral factors that contribute to delayed or reduced innate immunes responses are important for developing strategies to control cov infections. three human dubs cyld a20 and duba have been shown to negatively regulate the innate immune response by removing k63-based chains and usp15 inhibits the nfkb pathway by removing k48-ub from ikba preventing its degradation . here we investigate the molecular recognition of monoubiquitin k48-and k63-linked ubiquitin chains and isg15 by sars-cov plpro and test whether disrupting these interactions alters antagonism of the innate immune response. ikba is phosphorylated and degraded in response to tnfa an activator of the nfkb pathway. the retention of ub-amc hydrolysis activity and loss of recognition for the second ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like domain ub2 is a significant result as the decoupling of these two sites has yet to be achieved in other usp enzyme systems and signifies that it is achievable. as effector molecules ubiquitin chains and ubls such as isg15 must be recognized by downstream components through proteinprotein interactions to elicit the appropriate cellular response. the differentiation of various linkages and ubls by these interacting proteins is particularly important since the nature of the ubiquitin and ubl linkages dictates the downstream response.host immune response to the viral infection might be influenced by these antibodies. acute hepatitis with hav can also trigger an immune response therefore clinicians should consider this rare but serious possibility of guillain-barré syndrome following acute hepatitis a infection. recently granulicatella elegans was isolated from the central nervous system cns as well. for the confirmed cases we prospectively recorded the age sex immune status the form and the severity of the disease the response to the first and if applied to the second line of chemotherapy in some instances in association with antiretroviral therapy. identification and antibiotic resistance were determined using the vitek® 2 system biomérieux . these patients also had virologic response at eot. conclusions il-6 is secreted in response to viral infections and malignant transformation. vitek®2 compact automated system healthcare biomérieux usa was used for bacteria identification and antibiotic susceptibility. therefore il-6 may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses of the human body through many mechanisms. follow-up data is currently available for 60/87 patients 69 % and all achieved sustained virological response. the purpose of antiviral treatment is to eradicate hcv completely and obtain sustained virologic response svr . important central nervous system involvement with magnetic resonance imaging documented lesions was present in 5 patients but no fatal cases were registered.involvement of upr in innate immune response during coronavirus infection. therefore the activity of gadd34 in innate immune response seems to be cell type and stimulus-specific. the involvement of upr in apoptosis and innate immune response may be an important factor in the virulence and pathogenesis of coronavirus infection. the transcription factor xbp1 downstream of ire1 pathway has also been implicated in innate immune response fig 4 . however over-activation of the innate immune response is also associated with extensive tissue damage and immunopathogenesis associated with sars-cov infection perlman and dandekar 2005 . mature virions can be enclosed by apoptotic bodies and engulfed by neighboring cells or phagocytes allowing the virus to spread without initiating an immune response hay and kannourakis 2002 . besides the well characterized involvement of upr in nf-b and map kinase activation upr has also been shown to modulate innate immune response by other mechanisms. moreover viral components wrapped in apoptotic bodies may be taken up by dcs for antigen presentation and adaptive immune response schulz et al 2005 . therefore the ire1-ridd dependent signaling may be a general mechanism to bridge er stress and innate immune response and its implication during coronavirus infection deserves further investigation 5 . the implication of upr in host response will also be discussed with emphasis on apoptosis and innate immunity. it has been well established that the mitogen activated protein map kinases are key mediators of innate immunity and proinflammatory response zhang and dong 2005 . the importance of these mechanisms in host antiviral response can be manifested by the numerous counter measures evolved by coronaviruses and other viruses he 2006 .however these young animals in spite of having a non-totally-mature-immune system are immunocompetent from the birth and are capable of developing a complete immune response roth 1999 . even though there is no clear explanation for this fact the possibility of extraintestinal stimulation of the immune system has been proposed. as we have suggested for the in vivo response this difference could be attributed either to a lower sensitivity of the elispot performed with pedv or to differences in the immune response against each virus. results from the secondary immune response obtained after the in vitro stimulation are summarised in table 2 . using the elispot we demonstrated the early development of a primary speci®c immune response against pedv formerly igm asc followed by igg and iga asc responses. this dose was experimentally determined in previous assays in order to guarantee infection but without causing severe disease in order that immune response could be developed and detected in the piglets. finally we tried to emulate a natural infection by inoculating conventional pigs with a virulent strain of pedv and monitorised the humoral response in different locations of the lymphoid system involving gut associated lymphoid tissues as well as systemic tissues. pigs were inoculated orally with 3 ml of the virulent cv-777 a dose previously established which assesses a high rate of infection and the effective development of the immune response but without causing mortality among the pigs. however due to the special features of the mucosal immune system of the pigs the presence of serum antibodies against gastroenteric pathogens is not always correlated with protection saif and wesley 1999 saif 1996 saif et al 1994 to ã et al 1998 ward et al 1996 and only proves the contact with the microorganism. considering the fact that in the enteric infections in porcine is the local immunity which plays the main role in protection instead of the systemic immunity as previously mentioned the ®rst step was to develop techniques to investigate the immune response to pedv in different tissues. in the present work we have tried to contribute to the information on the immune mechanisms occurring after pedv infection by making a ®rst approach to the characterisation of the antibody response generated by the virus. although duodenum registered the highest number of speci®c-igg and iga asc of the three mucosal associated lymphoid tissues we consider that this result is more related to the distribution and organisation of the intestinal lymphoid tissue than to real differences in the immune response between tissues.first the immune response to lcmv has been well characterized 13 14 . characterization of the immune response to lcmv in transgenic mice. this model requires the transgenic mice to mount an immune response against the transgene which is a self-protein. thus the transgenic positive mice generated lcmv-specific humoral and cellular immune responses equivalent to transgenic negative mice indicating they were able to mount immune responses to the viral self-proteins expressed as transgenes. after poliovirus immunization of human adults previously vaccinated for polio in childhood immune responses to unrelated antigens reovirus and tetanus toxoid were observed indicating that secondary activation of immune responses also occurs in humans 53 . thus in this system it is possible to test whether the generation of an immune response agains abbreviations used in this paper: ␤ gal ␤ -galactosidase bhk baby hamster kidney cns central nervous system gfap glial fibrillary acidic protein gp glycoprotein i p peripheral lcmv lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus mbp myelin basic protein ms multiple sclerosis np nucleoprotein plp proteolipid protein pv pichinde virus tal-h human transaldolase vv vaccinia virus. adult transgenic mice were then infected with a virus that encoded the same gene did not infect the cns and was quickly cleared by the host immune response. the immune response to the viral infection results in a cross-reactive autoimmune attack against a target tissue expressing the mimicked protein. we found that the lcmv infection was efficiently cleared but a chronic cns autoimmune disease developed and was enhanced by a second infection with lcmv or with unrelated viruses that stimulated lcmv-specific memory immune responses. in this model system transgenic mice were generated that express a viral protein exclusively in oligodendrocytes. these mice were examined to determine whether the virus-induced immune response could result in an autoimmune attack against the viral transgene product expressed in oligodendrocytes leading to cns disease. it is likely that the nature of the immune response in the target organs is influenced by several factors including differences in permeability of the islet capillaries and blood-brain barrier to various immune cells in expression of adhesion and mhc molecules on endothelial and target cells in types of antigen-presenting cells present and in the local cytokine milieu.in conclusion in this study we revealed the immune response process of sars-cov-2 entering the blood circulation system using immune profiling analysis with single-cell resolution. doi 15 20033472 doi: medrxiv preprint in summary we demonstrated that sars-cov-2 can enter the blood through the circulatory system and cause a blood immune response after infection through the respiratory system. therefore the functions of blood and the immune system are inseparable. through downstream activation of mapk the expression of downstream effectors is activated by key transcription factors fos jun and junb which lead to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood system. these results suggested that immune deficiency or immune over-reacts may make patients with covid-19 go to worse condition because of their imbalance adaptive immune response . through downstream activation of mapk the expression of downstream effectors is activated by key transcription factors such as fos jun and junb which lead to a wide range of antiviral responses in the blood system fig 4c . these results suggested that the immune response may come back the normal situation when the patients recovery and the mapk signal is thus inhibited. the human adaptive immune system plays a critical role in defending against viral infections. doi doi: medrxiv preprint immune response to these antigens was detected for nc 1 and nc 3 for the nc 2 two antigens were detected hiv-1 and influenza a fig 3h . doi 15 20033472 doi: medrxiv preprint fos is up-regulated in hospitalized patients but down-regulated in cured patients b immunofluorescence staining of ifi27 in pbmcs of patients with covid-19 and normal controls c anti-sars-cov-2 response of the blood system. in order to differentiate the covid-19 immune response from other infectious diseases thereby identifying the unique covid-19 immune response we also recruited one case of influenza a patient 11 one case of acute pharyngitis patient 12 and one case of cerebral infarction patient 13 as controls table s1 . here we focus on insights into blood immune responses to covid-19 using 5 mrna tcr and bcr v d j recombination analysis wit single-cell resolution.moreover the pre-existing antiviral response will lead to rapid vector clearance and as such reduce exposure of the heterologous antigen taa to the immune system. depending on their activation they will instigate a specific immune response. the dc subsets co-operate in a wide range of immune responses through mechanisms that are relatively conserved across mammalian species. therefore the addition of stimulatory immune checkpoints like inclusion of cd70 or mgitrl-fusion proteins has been tested preclinically to enhance ctl responses 51 . additional studies are required to evaluate the correlation between these different innate signatures subsequent adaptive immune responses and protective efficacy. importantly most of the clinically evaluated vectors like pox-and adenoviral vectors show pre-existing immune responses in the host 165 . when in vivo vaccination of mice with a viral vector was compared to peptide dna or dc-vaccination the strongest tumor-specific immune responses were elicited with viral vectors . a phenomenon that was reinforced by the observation that rv-cea or -psa could only be administered once at most twice to result in a measurable immune response as after the third injection viral vector-neutralizing antibodies completely diminished the cellular and/or humoral anti-taa effect. when the immune responses generated with avx701 in colorectal cancer patients were compared between stage iii and iv patients the latter showed a trend for longer survival. therefore research into strategies to exploit the advantageous traits of viruses e g high infectivity adjuvant potential while avoiding their traits developed to avoid immune responses e g decreasing the translational machinery should be continued. so far the vaccine regimen was well tolerated and generated a strong anti-ny-eso-1 specific immune response in more than 50% of sarcoma patients with significant growth arrest and an overall survival rate 110 . when optimal priming of antiviral cd8 + t cells was investigated a response fundamentally similar to an antitumor immune response accumulation of pdcs at sites of cd8 + t cell activation led to local recruitment of cdc1 via xcl1 chemokine secretion by the cd8 + t cells.these cells are needed to see the full extent of the immune response to covs kindler et al 2013 . ifn␣ promotes the antiviral adaptive th-1 immune response to clear virus. mers-cov does not appear to be easily transmitted from dcs to humans or perhaps it does not trigger a detectable immune response if only mild disease or asymptomatic infection results. using this model a venezuelan equine encephalitis-based replicon expressing mers-cov spike protein was shown to be an efficacious vaccine candidate producing a protective immune response . professional cytokine-producing cells such as plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells and macrophages were lacking in the hae system but were present in the ex vivo tissues above. apart from a reduced innate antiviral response timing of the response also differed with mers-cov appearing to delay cytokine induction. this system aimed to recreate the main epithelial lining which is possibly the site of first contact between host and mers-cov kindler et al 2013 . therefore a disease model system is essential to study pathogenesis without the confounding influence of a raft of supportive medical procedures and of pre-existing chronic disease. an absence of mers-cov antibodies among slaughterhouse workers may reflect the killing of older dcs which are less often mers-cov positive see table 1 the rarity of infected animals a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering dcs aburizaiza et al 2014 a weak immune response by humans who do not get severe mers or an overall low risk of mers-cov transmission by contact. a strong neutralising antibody response was produced by the camels from 14 days post inoculation. patient 1 who died did not mount a robust type i ifn response while patient 2 who survived did mount a response particularly notable in patient 1 was the absence of ifn␣ and comparatively little rig-i mda5 irf3 irf7 il-12 and ifn␥ faure et al 2014 . these immune studies raise questions about whether age and immune status or genetic disorders which affect ifn signalling and production could be a risk factor for severe mers or whether the actions of mers-cov itself are sufficient to interfere with signalling.these tactics range from the prevention of detection to inhibition of antiviral responses mounted by the host immune system. in particular irf3 and irf7 play vital roles in activating innate immune response through their respective antiviral response . the maintenance of apoptosis is also important in the establishment and governance of immune responses in a cell. when the host immune system is exposed to viral pathogens it reacts straightaway by triggering a diverse array of defense mechanisms in order to establish a more efficacious shield. this provides an excellent method for a virus to disperse its progeny without eliciting host immune response . during infection the virus replicates in the host cytosol amidst a myriad of host signaling pathways and systems such that interaction between the virus and the host systems is inevitable. nlrs are stimulated by microbial agonists and collaborate with tlrs to evoke intracellular immune responses through mapk and caspase signaling cascades upon sensing bacterial components . the first line of defense is the mounting of an innate immune response as characterized by the increased production of type i interferons ifn-α and ifn-β and other inflammatory cytokines. thus coronaviruses do not just avoid detection by the host immune system which appears to be the main strategy of ensuring successful replication some viruses also encode proteins that function to disrupt the downstream signaling cascades at various points preventing the establishment of an effective antiviral state when detection of the viral pamps has occurred. autophagy is also known to mount crucial innate immune responses against invading pathogens with degradation of the latter through autophagy on the other hand autophagosomes may instead help promote virus infection by bringing together viral replicase proteins . coronaviruses encode many proteins see yellow boxes that target multiple steps in the innate immune response mounted by the host cells ensuring its successful replication in the host. previous studies on the infection of different hosts by nidoviruses for example have shown various modifications in host innate immune and stress responses cell cycle autophagy and cell death pathways all of which will be discussed in this review.this suggests that the type of alteration of the microbiome might be specific for rsv infection but also could be a more general effect of immune system perturbation. as recently reviewed by russel et al cxcl-8 and cxl-10 have been associated with immune pathology whereas ccl-5 in general is associated with a more beneficial immune response . induction of the initial innate immune response in epithelial cells and immune cells by rsv and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines should therefore be considered in the presence of these bacterial products . in conclusion haemophilus seems to be a strong correlate to the outcome for clinical manifestation of rsv disease viral load and cxcl8 immune response. npa samples were collected in which bacterial composition viral load and host immune responses were measured to allow for integrated analysis fig 1c . an important question this study tried to answer is whether nasopharyngeal microbiome composition relates to local viral load and exerts an influence on mucosal immune responses. viral load and mucosal immune responses are thought to directly impact disease severity and therefore it is difficult to disentangle these direct and indirect effects of the microbiome on disease outcome. our findings show a strong interdependency between the nasopharyngeal microbiota and the mucosal immune response potentially influencing severity of disease. the importance of the inflammatory response in the development of severe disease is further underlined by the association of the level of circulating immune cells and secreted cytokines with disease severity . both viral load and host immune responses are hypothesized to play a major role in the disease processes through which microbiota could potentially directly or indirectly assert their effect on the pathophysiology and the course of disease. prematurity young age 6 months and the presence of siblings or daycare attendance are important risk factors for severe rsv disease requiring hospitalization and respiratory support indicating that development of the immune system as well as environmental factors plays a role in the pathogenesis of rsv bronchiolitis . illumina 16s rrna amplicon libraries were generated and sequenced at baseclear bv leiden the netherlands on an illumina miseq paired-end 300 system.among these lymphotoxin-α lta is particularly interesting because of its role in the activation of innate and acquired immune responses lymphoid organogenesis and antiviral responses . adaptive immunity is the most involved part of the immune response and b lymphocytes are the hallmark of the disease. both ebv and hcv are associated with ss and may give rise to an aberrant activation of the immune system in genetically predisposed subjects. immune system cells may contribute to counteract the escape of malignant clones. this condition which is characterized by the emergence of pathogenic phyla lies at the basis of many autoimmune diseases as it may elicit sterile inflammation and prime the innate and acquired immune system . inflammasomes are multiproteic complexes elicited by the recognition of pathogen domains that may derive from microorganisms or cellular debris and cooperate with the tlr pathway in the innate immune response . commensal microorganisms compete with pathogens for substrates and do not usually induce an immune response because of the physical barriers that confine them to specific anatomical sites and impede their entry in the bloodstream and the active immunosurveillance exerted by resident and circulating immune cells. the activation of the innate immune system via the tlr pathway has also been found in proteomic studies of ss patients saliva which aberrantly expresses molecules such as s100 family proteins . in this context the increase in cd8+ lymphocytes in patients with more severe ss who are prone to develop lymphomas may represent an attempt of the immune system to prevent infected b cell proliferation. as ss is prevalent in women impaired methylation of the x chromosome which contains the largest number of genes coding for molecules related to the immune response including tlr7 has been suggested and demonstrated in salivary gland epithelial cells of ss patients . retroviruses can insert themselves into host cell dna modulate the transcription of cellular genes or generate aberrant transcripts that activate the innate immune response. it has been recently hypothesised that dysbiosis a change in the composition of the stable commensal microbiome is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases as it can guide the differentiation and the activation of cells belonging to the innate and adaptive immune system.the development of the various clinical forms is believed to be dependent on the host immune response. while strong cellular immune responses may control the disease pedersen 2009 pedersen 2014 weak cellular but vigorous b cell responses have been associated with the wet form and somewhat stronger t cell immune responses are thought to cause the dry form of fip pedersen 2009 pedersen 2014 . although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood it is generally accepted that the balance between cellular and humoral immune responses in infected animals critically determines the clinical progression of the disease. in another study this group addressed the question of whether 7a and 7b proteins interfere with the cellular innate immune system. it has been observed in field cases of fip that the wet form often develops during the terminal stage of dry fip probably reflecting a collapse of the immune system pedersen 2009 pedersen 2014 . in contrast to the targeted rna recombination system the bac system is suitable to mutagenize the entire fcov genome. so far three different reverse genetics systems have been described for fcovs. the advantages of this system are that desired changes can be introduced at any position of the viral genome and in contrast to escherichia coli-based cloning systems genetic instabilities of the fulllength fcov cdna insert in the vaccinia virus genome have never been observed. such a vaccinia virus-based system was reported for the serotype i fcov strain black tekes et al 2008 . however this approach requires the growth of field viruses in standard cell culture systems which has not been achieved so far. this system proved to be a very useful tool for modifying the fcov genome but for technical reasons only th -terminal third of the genome is amenable to mutagenesis via this approach. using the same plasmid construct and a recombinant virus lacking the entire orf7 a specific function of the 7a protein in counteracting ifn-α-induced antiviral responses was suggested dedeurwaerder et al 2014 .the final set of immune vips is made of the 203 vips annotated with the go categories immune system process go:0002376 defense response go:0006952 or immune response go:0006955 2015 in addition to 38 immune vips we annotated based on publications reporting roles in various parts of the immune response from innate to adaptive immune response from regulators to effectors of the immune response to vips involved in the development of the immune system. these 57 antiviral vips are part of a larger group of 241 vips 20% of vips with known immune functions defined here as any activity that modulates the immune response or involved in the development of the immune response materials and methods and supplementary file 1d . as such tfrc is the only clear-cut example of a host protein not involved in antiviral response that is known to adapt in response to viruses. there are reasons to believe that such an evolutionary response to viruses might be limited however. interestingly even immune vips supplementary file 1d have a significantly reduced pn/ps ratio compared to immune non-vips figure 3c which suggests that immune proteins in direct physical contact with viruses are more constrained. second adaptation in response to viruses is most likely not restricted to proteins that physically interact with viruses. the lack of a signal is unlikely to be due to reduced statistical power of the comparison in a smaller set of immune proteins given that 1000 random samples of non-immune vips with the same size as the immune vips sample 241 always exhibited a significantly p 0 05 increased rate of adaptation compared to non-immune non-vips. as expected immune vips have a very strong excess of adaptation compared to immune non-vips figure 5c . this is particularly relevant because to our knowledge the transferrin receptor tfrc is one of the only well understood case of a non-antiviral protein adapting in response to viruses demogines et al 2013 . intriguingly unlike for non-immune vips or all vips considered together top of figure 4b immune vips including antiviral vips supplementary file 1d do not show any increase of adaptation compared to immune non-vips. for instance as much as one third of the adaptive mutations that affect human proteins seem to have occurred in response to viruses. supplementary file 1d lists all the immune vips identified.these amounts have been sufficient to elicit strong immune responses. this immune response led to the acquisition of immunity by newborn piglets i. sola and l. enjuanes unpublished results . the alphaviruses include the sindbis virus semliki forest virus sfv and venezuelan equine encephalitis virus veev and are very efficient at eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses. driving vector expression to different tissues may be highly convenient in order to preferentially induce a specific type of immune response i e mucosal immunity by targeting the expression to gut-associated lymph nodes. coronaviruses have several advantages for use as vectors over other viral expression systems: i coronaviruses are single-stranded rna viruses that replicate within the cytoplasm without a dna intermediary making integration of the virus genome into the host cell chromosome unlikely lai and cavanagh 1997 ii these viruses have the largest rna virus genome and in principle have room for the insertion of large foreign genes masters 1999 enjuanes et al 2000a iii a pleiotropic secretory immune response is best induced by the stimulation of gut-associated lymphoid tissues. since coronaviruses in general infect the mucosal surfaces both respiratory and enteric they may be used to target the antigen to the enteric and respiratory areas to induce a strong secretory immune response enjuanes and van der zeijst 1995 iv the tropism of coronaviruses may be modified by the manipulation of the spike s protein allowing engineering of the tropism of the vector ballesteros et al 1997 leparc-goffart et al 1998 sánchez et al 1999 kuo et al 2000 v non-pathogenic coronavirus strains infecting most species of interest human porcine bovine canine and feline are available to develop expression systems sánchez et al 1992 and vi infectious coronavirus cdna clones are available to design expression systems almazan et al 2000 yount et al 2000 thiel et al 2001 . the sequences that regulate transcription have been characterized mainly using helper dependent expression systems and it will now be possible to validate them using single genome systems. nevertheless expression systems have been developed for the porcine and hcov since minigenomes are only available for these two coronaviruses. coronaviruses are associated mainly with respiratory enteric hepatic and central nervous system diseases. coronavirus derived expression systems are being developed for human porcine murine bovine and avian coronaviruses. 3d -e an expression system has been developed méndez et al 1995 izeta et al 1999 . the helper dependent expression systems have been developed using members of the three groups of coronaviruses fig 3 and will be addressed first.despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to sars-cov-2 these epitopes are motivated by responses they have recorded in sars-cov or for the case of t cell epitopes to at least confer mhc binding and the fact that they map identically to sars-cov-2 based on the available sequence data as of 21 february 2020 . worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly spreading virus that causes this disease sars-cov-2 originally tentatively named 2019-ncov and to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it . at this early stage there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against sars-cov-2 which presents a challenge for vaccine development. despite the apparent similarity between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 there is still considerable genetic variation between the two and it is not obvious a-prior if epitopes that elicit an immune response against sars-cov are likely to be effective against sars-cov-2. we focused specifically on the s and n proteins as these are known to induce potent and long-lived immune responses in sars-cov 19 20 25 27 . the estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one t cell epitope from the set. we first report the analysis for t cell epitopes which have been shown to provide a long-lasting immune response against sars-cov followed by a discussion of b cell epitopes. we focused particularly on the epitopes in the s and n structural proteins due to their dominant and long-lasting immune response previously reported against sars-cov. due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against sars-cov may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for sars-cov-2. further experimental studies t cell and b cell assays are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against sars-cov-2. various reports related to sars-cov suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. interestingly the majority of the t cell epitopes for which a positive immune response has been determined using t cell assays table 2 were presented by the globally most-prevalent mhc allele shown in blue color in table 3 .in addition most of those who have died from mers-cov sars-cov and 2019-ncov were advance in age and had underlying health conditions such as hypertension diabetes or cardiovascular disease that compromised their immune systems . all vaccine candidates for sars and mers were reported to be safe well-tolerated and able to trigger the relevant and appropriate immune responses in the participants. there were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks and vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were respectively detected in 77% and 64% participants at week 60. molecules developed by the university scientists inhibit two coronavirus enzymes and prevent its replication. t-cell responses were detected in 71% and 76% participants after 2 and 3 doses respectively. interferons with or without ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir are most likely to be beneficial and are being trialed in china for 2019-ncov. due to the close genetic relatedness of sars-cov 79% with 2019-ncov there may be potential cross-protective effect of using a safe sars-cov vaccine while awaiting the 2019-ncov vaccine. synthetic oligonucleotide positive control or 2019-ncov have yet to be tested . based on current evidence pathogenicity for 2019-ncov is about 3% which is significantly lower than sars-cov 10% and mers-cov 40% . there is however currently a lack of understanding of what is available in the early phase of 2019-ncov outbreak. there were two independent reviewers each focusing on sars mers and 2019-ncov respectively. with the possible expansion of 2019-ncov globally and the declaration of the 2019-ncov outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern by the world health organization there is an urgent need for rapid diagnostics vaccines and therapeutics to detect prevent and contain 2019-ncov promptly. vaccines against the 2019-ncov are currently in development and none are in testing at the time of writing .however recent concepts in immunology provide a link between innate and adaptive immune responses and suggest that the quality quantity and longevity of adaptive immune responses is determined very early after infection or vaccination . live viral vaccines consist of attenuated replication-competent viruses that are believed to be superior in the induction of broad immune responses including cell-mediated immunity. of major importance are professional antigen-presenting cells papcs such as dendritic cells dcs and macrophages which play a major role in i sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns ii inducing innate immune responses and iii shaping the upcoming adaptive immune response. second a recent in vitro study suggests that sars-cov nsp1 may be associated with host cell mrna degradation and may counteract innate immune responses . the presented results indicate that nsp1 plays a crucial role in the mhv life cycle by interfering with host innate immune responses. efficient live attenuated vaccines should therefore not only lack significant pathogenicity but should also deliver antigens to papcs and activate the innate immune system. similar to replication kinetics in cell lines figure 2b prevention of viral diseases by vaccination aims for controlled induction of protective immune responses against viral pathogens. in contrast live attenuated vaccines consist of replicationcompetent viruses that induce broad cellular and humoral immune responses without causing disease . recent reports indicate that coronaviruses most likely express a number of proteins such as mhv and sars-cov nucleocapsid proteins and sars-cov orf3b and orf6 proteins that may interact with innate immune responses . images were processed using adobe photoshop adobe systems link . mhv-nsp1d99 was not detectable in other non-hematopoietic organs such as lung and central nervous system unpublished data . interference with the type i ifn system appears to be the dominant mode of action of murine coronavirus nsp1.the immune response to sars-cov-2 in humans awaits characterization but human immune responses against other coronaviruses have been investigated. limited information is currently available on which parts of the sars-cov-2 sequence are recognized by human immune responses. the present study identifies likely targets of the human immune response to sars-cov-2 encompassing both the b and t cell arms of the adaptive immune response. in brief grifoni et al identify potential targets for immune responses to the 2019 novel coronavirus sars-cov-2 by sequence homology with closely related sars-cov and by a priori epitope prediction using bioinformatics approaches. this analysis provides essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and for evaluating diagnostic and vaccine candidates. this is of relevance in the face of the ever growing medical and societal urgency surrounding covid-19 especially given the current scarcity of experimental data regarding any corresponding immune response. vaccination strategies designed to target the immune response toward these conserved epitope regions could generate immunity that is not only cross-protective across betacoronaviruses but also relatively resistant to ongoing virus evolution. in conclusion the use of available information related to sars-cov epitopes in conjunction with bioinformatic predictions points to specific regions of sars-cov-2 that have a high likelihood of being recognized by human immune responses. in terms of the host in which the various b and t cell epitopes were recognized table 2 most epitopes either b or t were defined in humans or murine systems. the virus pathogen resource vipr is a complementary repository of information about human pathogenic viruses that integrates genome gene and protein sequence information with data about immune epitopes protein structures and host responses to virus infections pickett et al 2012 . in the case of the spike glycoprotein figure 2a we identify five regions of potential interest residues 274-306 510-586 587-628 784-803 and 870-893 all representing regions associated with high immune response rates. our analysis showed that certain sars-cov regions were dominant for b cell responses and that those regions were well conserved in terms of sequence with sars-cov-2.it has been hypothesized that because of a lack of mhc variability cheetahs may be deficient in their ability to present fipv antigen and mount protective immune responses o brien et al 1985 . cats which were infected experimentally with tgev shed the virus in their feces and mounted homologous and heterologous humoral immune responses reynolds and garwes 1979 . cats infected with ccv remained clinically normal and demonstrated homologous as well as heterologous humoral immune responses but virus was not detectable in their stools barlough et al 1984 . though the s proteins have traditionally been associated with the induction of protective immune responses to coronaviruses mab to the m protein of mhv has been shown to protect mice against acute encephalitis fleming et al 1989 . the s protein forms the peplomers which project from the surface of virions and are responsible for receptor binding induction of cellto-cell fusion and fusion of the viral envelope with target cell membranes induction of neutralizing ab and induction of cell-mediated immune cmi responses. central nervous system cns and ocular involvement are more common with the non-effusive form of fip. however cmi responses may also contribute to the granulomatous lesions seen in noneffusive fip when cmi responses are only partially protective pedersen 1983b weiss and cox 1989 . it has been suggested that cmi responses may be important in immunity pedersen and floyd 1985 scott 1989 . they initially found a strong dth response in an fip-resistant cat but only minimal response in a susceptible cat weiss and cox 1988 . many coronaviruses induce diseases limited to a single organ system. in other virus systems it has also been suggested that enhancing ab may facilitate uncoating jolly 1989 porterfield 1986 robinson et al 1989a . further support for the importance of cmi responses to fipv resistance comes from work in nude mice.coronaviruses have long been known to efficiently evade host innate immune responses during the early phase of the infection. collectively these results demonstrate that the coronavirus endou activity plays a pivotal role in innate immune evasion in the context of the ifn-i system. a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 host innate immune responses are of particular importance during the early phase of virus infection to restrict virus replication and spread. while this strategy indirectly impacts host cell innate immune responses a more specific interaction of rna decay and host cell dsrna responses has recently been described for vaccinia virus decapping enzymes d9 and d10 . early and rapid sars-cov replication in the respiratory tract combined with a delayed ifn-i response can result in dysregulated innate immune responses and inflammatory cytokine-driven extensive lung damage. mhv as a natural mouse pathogen has been instrumental to understand the delicate balance between host ifn-i responses to infection and counteracting mechanisms of coronavirus innate immune evasion. in the light of our results it is tempting to speculate that the endou domain has evolved in vertebrate nidoviruses corona-and arteriviridae to counteract vertebrate-specific innate immune sensing of viral rna in the context of the type-i interferon system while the absence of the endou domain in roni-and mesoniviruses is indicative of fundamentally different mechanisms of rna virus innate immune sensing and antiviral effector pathways in invertebrates e g crustaceans and insects . the regression model is an exponential saturation model increasing response with constant asymptote that additionally allows a peak response. recombinant ifnα a/d sigma was used as a cytokine standard and luciferase activity was detected 16 hours p i by a luminometer luciferase assay system promega . surprisingly although endou is coexpressed with other key replicative proteins as part of the viral replicase polyprotein its enzymatic activity is not essential for viral rna synthesis in most cell culture systems . they are well known to evade innate immune activation particularly during the early phase of the infection . recombinant mhv strain a59 hcov-229e mhv h277a hcov-229e h250a and mhv d130a were generated using the vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system as previously described 9 .introduction: primary immunodeficiencies pids are a heterogeneous group of disorders that affect immune system development and function. introduction: the human leukocyte antigen hla system is the genomic region that regulates the human immune system by encoding proteins for the cell wall that are responsible for self-recognition. results: immune sequencing libraries were generated from total rna extracted from pbmcs in duplicate from a single patient and sequenced. introduction: adenoviruses adv cause a wide range of illnesses from mild respiratory infections in young children to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system including transplant recipients. the purpose of this study was to assess the throughput performance of this new system as it compares to the original filmarray system. to date we have received detailed responses from 13 providers and we expect more before the amp meeting. method: we have developed and optimized a method for accurate sequencing of full-length immune gene repertoires of b-cells and t-cells. in contrast multiple studies have reported the association of specific mutations in several immune and epigenetic modifier genes with certain subtypes of lymphoma. further emast-h tumors were associated with msi rather than loh at tp53 the absence of pni overall and crohns-like response in those crcs demonstrating only tetranucleotide instability. a reduction of 3 logs or more from the baseline is considered a major therapeutic response. the standard approach involves the tabulation of each immune receptor gene sequence to determine the distribution of clonal rearrangements within a lymphocyte population. libraries were then purified normalized pooled and sequenced on the illumina miseq system.the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov which emerged in wuhan hubei china has also been identified in this region huang et al 2020 . the high virulence of ebov is attributed to the ability of the virus to interfere with the host immune system rivera and messaoudi 2016 . to be efficiently transmitted by mosquitoes a virus must successfully infect replicate and disseminate in the mosquito s cells and be able to evade the mosquito antiviral immune responses. complete genomic information of pathogenic viruses is of importance for the rapid and rational design of vaccines based on identifications of key viral protein antigens that induce immune response rather than on the whole viruses. other molecular methods for detecting pathogenic viruses such as direct nucleic acid detection by a biosensor saylan et al 2019 and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr diagnostics using crispr-crispr-associated system crispr-cas chertow 2018 have also been developed. rapid and accurate detection of emerging viruses is essential for rapid response optimized clinical care and to limit the spread of these viruses. to address the possibility that pathogenic viruses may be misused for malicious purposes implementation of a biosecurity system in any laboratory working with pathogenic viruses is recommended. monitoring studies in wild birds can be used as an early warning system for the incursion of a range of zoonotic viruses michel et al 2018 . as handling pathogenic viruses pose the risk of infection to laboratory personnel and also potentially to community and environment good laboratory biosafety and biosecurity systems need to be established. hence the availability of deep freezers for adequate specimen storage and power back-up systems for an uninterrupted power supply is also crucial wolking 2013 fowler et al 2014 . the laboratory biosecurity system should cover physical security virus control and accountability personnel security transport security and information security the implementation of which needs to be integrated with the overall biosafety plan artika and ma roef 2018 . the virus entry and replication stimulates the host antiviral and proinflammatory responses apoptosis and disrupts regulation of glial cell proliferation wang et al 2017 .some reports have indicated that stimulation of the host immune system. host immune responses approach is that t cells

organ or tissue except the reproductive tract in carrier animals. however it is also possible that variation exists between individual stallions in the efficacy of eav-specific immune responses within the reproductive tract that can operate independently of the eqcxcl16 genotype. indeed inflammatory infiltrates in close proximity to viral antigen-expressing cells are frequently observed in the stallion reproductive tract indicating that eav persistence is a continuous dynamic process that occurs in the presence of active local immune responses. potential explanations range from some form of localized immunosuppression based on the fact that androgens such as testosterone can down-regulate immune responses to more specific activity such as that mediated by t regulatory lymphocytes or even to differences in functional properties between eqcxcl16s and eqcxcl16r. clearly these responses are not completely effective in clearance of the virus for reasons that are unknown at present. monoclonal antibody binding was detected by the ecl-detection system using supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate thermo scientific . the membranes were washed again and antibody binding was visualized with an ecl-detection system using supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate thermo scientific . cell migration in response to eqcxcl16s and eqcxcl16r proteins was determined using a

cd3 + t lymphocyte migration in response to pretreatment of these molecules with gp α-eqcxcl16 pab was similar to that observed in the medium only control. samples were resolved in sds-polyacrylamide

than 0 05 were considered to be statistically significant. effect of amino acid substitutions in the eqcxcl16 protein on response to eav infection recently we demonstrated that the membrane-associated form of the chemokine encoded by the eqcxcl16sa allele can function as a host-cell receptor for eav binding and entry .pathogen-derived proteases range from nonspecific proteases that degrade multiple proteins involved in the immune response to enzymes that are very specific in their mode of action. proteases play significant roles in innate as well as adaptive immune response. during the last decade our understanding of both adaptive and innate immune responses has greatly increased. the study shows that the functions of proteinases in the virus entry into the cell as well as in host immune response are relevant for the possible therapy with inhibitors. although protease inhibitors have a potential use as therapeutics in virus infections the effects on innate and adaptive immune response should not be underestimated. the innate immune system detects molecular structures denoted as pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps that are distinct from host molecular pattern and are frequently found in bacteria fungi virus and some protozoans. the understanding of the mechanisms by which proteinases and inhibitors used by the pathogens interfere with the host adaptive and innate immune response is essential for the development of therapeutic inhibitors. many pathogens also synthesize cysteine proteases that act on target proteins in the host and thereby modulate host immune response. clearance of the virus was delayed in cathepsin l-and cathepsin s-deficient mice in comparison to the levels for wild type and cathepsin b-deficient mice as a consequence of the important functions of the two cathepsins in immune response . these pamps are detected using an array of pattern-recognition receptors prrs which are expressed at the first line of defense against infection by cells like macrophages monocytes dendritic cells neutrophils and epithelial cells as well as cells of the adaptive immune system . indeed amino-acid sequences typical of pathogen proteases exist in key molecules involved in host immune response regulation including immunoglobulins ig cytokines and chemokines. they can change their physiology in response to microenvironmental stimuli.netlogo is an agent-based modeling of the immune system running different simulations with different parameter settings. nowadays powerful immune system simulators have been developed using bioinformatics tools which predict artificial immunity provided by the vaccine. a successful vaccine must elicit a strong t-cell and b-cell immune response but above all provide protection against the disease being targeted. moreover the l1/l2-specific antibody and t-cell immune responses induced by l1 and l2 dna constructs were assessed in mouse tumor model. furthermore our data indicated that the ratios of ifn-γ/il-10 and ifn-γ/il-5 were higher in all test groups as compared to control groups therefore they could trigger th1 immune response. there is a multi-scale computational infrastructure approach which can stimulate the dynamics of the immune response induced by several vaccination formulations and predict optimal combination in terms of adjuvant type dosage and timing. the studies showed that immunoglobulin g1 igg1 is related to a th2-type response while a th1 response is associated with the induction of igg2a and igg2b in mice 40 . no significant anti- l1 + l2 antibody responses could be detected in the sera of control groups thus the seroreactivities were completely l1 + l2 antigen-specific responses in mice. mhc-ii -peptide docking scores of selected helper t-cell epitopes higher rate shows better quality of peptide-mhc interactions www nature com/scientificreports www nature com/scientificreports/ immune responses against all high-risk hpv types. however optimal peptide-based vaccines should be presented in a desired secondary structure of peptides in order to induce a specific humoral response 41 42 . the supernatants were harvested to assess the secretion of ifn-γ il-5 and il-10 from t-cells using the sandwich-based elisa method r d systems according to the manufacturer s instructions. after in vitro assay immunological experiments were performed in mice to determine the efficiency of the designed l1 and l2 dna constructs without the use of adjuvant or delivery system for vaccine development.this vaccine was shown to initiate both humoral and cellmediated immune host responses . next to cytocidal effects also immune-mediated mechanisms of both the innate and adaptive immune system seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of sars-cov infections. the reason for the milder clinical presentation of sars in children is most likely due to differences in developmental stage of the immune system. these results indicated that an adenoviral-based vaccine can induce sars-cov-specific immune responses in monkeys. also t-cell responses against the nucleocapsid protein were found and all vaccinated animals displayed strong neutralising antibody responses in vitro. in this respect a multi-valent approach which induces both humoral and t cell-mediated host responses seems to be the most attractive strategy. with regard to the multitude of potential epithelial target cells specific endogenous drug delivery systems may also be of relevance. coronaviruses are known to exert their effects by cytocidal and immune-mediated mechanisms. so far a variety of antiviral drugs or prodrugs such as valacyclovir valganciclovir or the valyl ester of zidovudine have been shown to be transported via these systems and minimal structure requirements for substrate transport have been determined . the spike protein showed the strongest initial responses to positive selection pressures . also tgev and mhv tend to cause chronic infections as these viruses may be found in the airways and small intestine tgev or the nervous system mhv several months after infection . it is therefore crucial that these immune mechanisms are further analysed on the molecular level as it seems appropriate that not only antiviral but also antiinflammatory strategies are evaluated for a use in the clinical management of future sars cases.specific antiviral therapies that inhibit viral replication and spread or tolerize the antiviral immune response in model systems may eventually provide a guide for curing autoimmune diseases. immune responses are believed to be regulated by a balance of thl and th2 cytokines . il-4 and il-10 are th2 cytokines and along with tgf- 3 have been shown to inhibit thl cells in vitro and are thought to have an inhibitory effect on certain immune responses in vivo. an immune response elicited against the pathogen will eliminate it but can also cross-react with one or more self-antigens that share determinants with the agent. evidence for such cross-reactive immune responses between viruses/microbes and self-antigens has been noted by many investigators 19 21° 22-24 25°° 26 . this allows critical assessment of the immune response and cellular factors that is cytokines that play a role in breaking tolerance to the self-marker protein and thereby cause autoimmune disease. recently examples of cross-reactivities or abnormal immune responses between viruses and self-proteins have been described for rheumatoid arthritis celiac disease primary biliary cirrhosis 21° myocarditis systemic lupus erythematosus and ms . superantigens have also been implicated in triggering autoimmune responses . two new strategies oral tolerance induction and the use of mhc class i restricted peptides to modulate the autoreactive immune response have shown promise in this regard . the influence of host genetic factors in the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases is taken into account as well in molecular mimicry since host genes control immune responses to various infectious agents play a role in the expression of viral receptors and can influence viral replication. the idea is to turn on a th2-type profile response in the target area. viral infections can induce both high-affinity ctls that are important for viral clearance and lower-affinity ctl responses.despite having limited understanding of how the human immune system responds naturally to sars-cov-2 these epitopes are motivated by their responses that they have recorded in sars-cov or for the case of t cell epitopes to at least confer mhc binding and the fact that they map identically to sars-cov-2 based on the available sequence data as of 9 february 2020 . at this early stage there is also a lack of information about specific immune responses against sars-cov-2 which presents a challenge for vaccine development. population coverages for sets of t cell epitopes were computed using the tool provided by the immune epitope database iedb link vita et al 2019 . the estimated population coverage represents the percentage of individuals within the population that are likely to elicit an immune response to at least one t cell epitope from the set. we focused particularly on the epitopes in the s and n structural proteins due to their dominant and longlasting immune response previously reported against sars-cov. whether the antibodies specific to this motif maintain their binding and elicit an immune response against sars-cov-2 warrants further experimental investigation. further experimental studies t cell and b cell assays are required to determine the potential of the identified epitopes to induce a positive immune response against sars-cov-2. due to this apparent similarity between the two viruses previous research that has provided an understanding of protective immune responses against sars-cov may potentially be leveraged to aid vaccine development for sars-cov-2. various reports related to sars-cov suggest a protective role of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. we first report the analysis for t cell epitopes which have been shown to provide a long-lasting immune response against sars-cov channappanavar et al 2014 followed by a discussion of b cell epitopes . worldwide collaborative efforts from scientists are underway to understand the novel and rapidly spreading virus that causes this disease sars-cov-2 originally tentatively named 2019-ncov and to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing it heymann 2020 huang et al 2020 xin liu wang 2020 zhou et al 2020 . while being effective the antibody response was found to be short-lived in convalescent sars-cov patients tang et al 2011 .over stimulation of immune responses can also lead to pathogenesis. this results in a decrease of the levels of mhc-i molecules blue rectangles at the plasma membrane preventing the infected cell to be recognized by the immune system. that is why cells have evolved mechanisms to sense the ion imbalances caused by infections and elaborate immune responses to counteract viruses. this mhc-i trafficking defect allows the evasion of adaptive immune responses leading to more productive infections figure 4 . besides their key role in virus propagation viroporins are also virulence factors in different viral systems. amantadine and hexamethylene amiloride are effective inhibitors of hcv p7 ic activity as shown using in vitro systems . secreted il-1β mediates a potent pro-inflammatory response that can be deleterious for the cell and the organism when overstimulated. edema accumulation and airway epithelia damage is accompanied by an exacerbated proinflammatory response in the lung parenchyma . the relevance of ion conductivity in boosting virus production remains unknown for the moment in other viral systems. il-1β is a key orchestrator of the inflammatory response and plays a critical role in counteracting invading viruses however overstimulation of this pathway can lead to unwanted deleterious effects for the organism. the nlrp3 inflammasome is one of the most extensively studied . larger viroporins have also been described in covs.nevertheless the results obtained for rig-i ifn-1 ifn-2/3 and ip-10 clearly demonstrate that dd778 can boost the innate immune response in virus-infected cells in particular the expression of type iii ifns which were produced at high levels in this system. however the mechanisms linking the intracellular pool of pyrimidines to the innate immune response remain to be characterized. it should be noted that cells were infecte before the addition of dd778 thus allowing the accumulation of viral rnas necessary to trigger the innate immune response before the antiviral state was settled. one explanation is that mv encodes virulence factors that interfere with the innate immune response in particular the v protein that binds directly to mda5 to prevent its activation and counteract ifn-␤ expression . sting-37 reporter cells were transfected with low doses of short synthetic 5=triphosphate rna molecules ssrna to prime the innate immune response without reaching saturation and were cultured with dd778 or dmso alone for 24 h. as shown in fig 6a dd778 amplified isre-luciferase expression in response to ssrna transfection. however it was also reported that inhibiting de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis stimulates the innate immune response in particular the transcription of some interferon-stimulated genes isgs independently of interferons ifns and the canonical jak-stat pathway 8 . altogether these different reports support a key role of the innate immune response in the antiviral activity of compounds inhibiting the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. in mv-infected cells dd778 also increased the expression of ifn-1 and ifn-2/3 which were produced at high levels in this system. thus sting-37 cells were infected with mv at different multiplicities of infection mois and incubated fo to let the virus trigger the innate immune response and dd778 or dmso alone was added for an additional incubation period of 16 h. as shown in fig 6b dd778 efficiently boosted the cellular response to mv infection as assessed by increased expression levels of the isre-luciferase reporter gene. sting-37 cells were infected with mv moi ϭ 2 and incubated fo to let the virus trigger the innate immune response and dd778 or dmso alone was added for an additional incubation period of 39 h. ifn-␤ ifn-1 ifn-2/3 and ip-10 were quantified in culture supernatants fig 8a whereas mda5 and rig-i expression levels were determined by western blotting on cellular pellets fig 8b . finally we determined if dd778 could also boost the expression of ifns in response to ssrna something that was not investigated before. this demonstrated that pyrimidine depletion is responsible for the amplified response to ssrna in agreement with our previous report on dd264 8 .our findings are interesting and it seems that the phages bearing heterologous peptides may stimulate t lymphocytemediated immune response and phage-based vaccines can be used as excellent heterologous antigens recognized by specific antigenpresenting cells initiating host immune responses. the results showed that the peptides displayed on filamentous phages triggered an immune response in mice against the tge virions. the m protein as the major interferon inducing component has been proposed to play a role in innate immune response to coronaviruses charley and laude 1988 laude et al 1992 . moreover the peptide-containing phages elicited effective immune response in vivo demonstrating a potential perspective in development of phage-based vaccines. in our study the high level expression of papn was achieved again in this expression system. another significant achievement of this work is the demonstration that the identified phages bearing the specific peptides in their n-terminal region of major coat protein pviii may induce specific humoral immune responses and an enhanced cell-medicated immunity. the phages bearing the specific peptides may elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses indicating that the present methodology has the potential to develop novel phage-based novel vaccines. the tge virion and ibv s protein produced from the same expression system were used as positive and negative controls respectively. the papn-recognizing peptides elicited stronger humoral immune response than the control phages bearing complex peptides although the control serum might also react with the tge virions to certain extent fig 6 . the prokaryotic system is an optimal choice for achieving a high-level expression of heterologous protein yin et al 2007 . many studies have provided direct or indirect evidence for the involvement of s protein in inducing a protective immune response or in viral pathogenicity daniel and talbot 1990 torres et al 1996 krempl et al 1997 wang et al 1992 . many heterologous proteins have been expressed in this system li et al 2010a b meng et al 2010 ren et al 2010a d .it remains to be seen during the current wuhan 2019-ncov epidemic how this newly-emergent coronavirus affects pregnant women and their infants as well as which factors may modulate obstetrical disease and outcomes including the timing of maternal coronavirus exposure by gestational age the effects of medications or other treatment regimens differences in host immune responses occurrence of coexisting medical and obstetrical conditions and other covariables. most fatalities have been associated with pre-existing medical conditions like chronic lung disease diabetes and renal failure as well as weakened immune systems making such individuals high risk. in contrast to other reported cases this patient had a successful outcome perhaps due to the timing of mers-cov exposure her young age the use of steroids and differences in immune response. however pregnant women should be considered to be at high risk for developing severe infection during this current outbreak of 2019-ncov. on 7 january 2020 investigators in china identified the etiological agent of the epidemic as a previously unknown coronavirus and it was given the designation 2019-ncov for 2019 novel coronavirus . it is vitally important that pregnant women be considered in the design clinical trial and implementation of vaccine candidates for 2019-ncov. it is certain that 2019-ncov will infect women who are pregnant leaving the question open as to whether the novel coronavirus will have a similar or different effect on them compared with sars-cov and mers-cov. the overall cfr of mers is approximately 34 4% . additional clinical research on the treatment of sars mers and the new coronavirus 2019-ncov is necessary if we are to understand the potential risks and benefits of novel therapies and new vaccines in pregnancy. on 31 december 2019 the chinese center for disease control and prevention china cdc sent a rapid response team to hubei to work alongside health personnel from the provincial and wuhan city health departments to conduct an epidemiologic investigation. an additional 307 cases of 2019-ncov infection have occurred among 24 other countries outside of china figure 1 at the meeting of the emergency committee of the who on 30 january the novel coronavirus 2019 epidemic was declared a public health emergency of international concern pheic . on 5 february 2020 it was reported by multiple media outlets that a newborn infant delivered during the epidemic in wuhan had tested positive for 2019-ncov at the wuhan children s hospital in hubei province 30 hours following its birth.the innate immune system serves as the first line of defense in protection of the host against viral infections and helps to shape the resultant adaptive immune response. because alveolar type ii cells at the air-liquid interface were highly susceptible to hcov-hku1 infection we could measure changes in the level of expression of select genes of the innate immune system in these cells in response to hcov-hku1 infection. the characteristics of the initial immune response can greatly impact the resulting clinical outcome . expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to viral infection argues that type ii alveolar cells are not only target cells for infection but are also immune-competent and may directly influence the immune response to viral infection. because they are the natural target cells for respiratory virus infection primary human respiratory epithelial cell cultures provide the ideal in vitro systems for investigation of cell factors required for growth of respiratory human viruses for analysis of their interactions with viruses and their innate immune responses to infection and for isolation and propagation of novel respiratory pathogens. furthermore we reasoned that infecting primary human alveolar cells would allow us to determine which subset of cells is susceptible to infection and to characterize initial innate immune responses of alveolar epithelial cells to viruses that cause lower respiratory tract diseases. alternatively it could be due to the presence of unique viral proteins which can suppress the ifn response. utilization of this culture system is appealing because it most closely represents the in vivo physiological conditions of the lung . in summary hcov-hku1 can infect be serially propagated and induce an anti-viral response in human alveolar type ii cells maintained at an air-liquid interface. the rt-pcrs were performed using a 1-step reverse-transcription pcr master mix rna ultrasense one-step quantitative rt-pcr system invitrogen life technologies carlsbad ca . thus human alveolar type ii cells induce significant innate anti-viral responses to infection with hcov-hku1 but the extent of these responses varied in different humans with different levels of infection. this may have important implications as recently it was shown that the level of cytokine responses in type ii alveolar cells induced by different strains of influenza a viruses were correlated with degree of pathogenicity .these viruses are not known to elicit an immune response and are not expected to be captured by the antibody-bound beads. furthermore it could be that the immune response to enteroviruses is poor especially in immunocompromised patients which is the case in our study patients with diarrhoea. on the other hand it has been published that hiv-1 infected patients are not hampered in their immune response to enteroviruses and chronic shedding is as rare as in the normal population . a pathogenic virus elicits an immune response in the host whereas bacteriophages and plant viruses which are also massively present in stool do not. antibody response to a virus infection can vary depending on the virus but also age and immune state of patients. the platinum quantitative pcr supermix-udg system invitrogen was used. in summary a new selective approach for virus discovery is presented that enables detection of viruses that have recently elicited an immune response resulting in antibody production. to facilitate the detection of immunogenic viruses and to reduce the detection of non disease-related viruses bacteriophages and plant viruses and host cellular rna a technique was developed that uses convalescent serum of the patient to concentrate viruses that have elicited and immune response prior to sequencing. also antibodies subclasses can differ some viruses elicit a strong igg response while others induce a response dominated by iga. the method appears to be an effective tool for reducing host dna/ rna and bystander virus sequences and provides a selection for viruses that are able to elicit an antibody response thus agents that are possibly pathogenic for the host. also enteroviruses were poorly captured. vidisca and roche titanium-454 sequencing vidisca-454 was performed as previously described .it is therefore tempting to speculate that the strong immune response elicited by the refecv-s 79 infection eliminated the virus. since the s1 domain is known to be a major antigenic determinant for the induction of adaptive immune responses 54 it is conceivable that the observed changes in this subunit represent immune escape variants. interestingly and in contrast to the titers obtained for fcov very high ͼ1:20 480 serum antibody titers were determined for both recfecv-s 79 -infected cats reflecting a strong immune response that was most likely due to a systemic infection. accordingly reverse genetic systems have been established only for covs including fcovs for which cell culture systems are available that efficiently support viral replication 40 . thus far reverse genetics systems for fecv field isolates have not been available. virus shedding and the antibody response of cats 5 and 6 were monitored for 8 5 weeks as previously described. obviously the protocols developed in this study may also be useful to develop reverse genetics systems for other rna viruses with large genomes such as other coronaviruses and nidoviruses for which suitable cell culture systems are not available. furthermore blood samples were collected weekly to monitor fcov-specific antibody responses in serum samples during the course of the experiment. serotype i fecv field isolates cannot be propagated in standard cell culture systems. this localization of amino acid substitutions on the surface of the s1 subunit including its 0 domain strongly suggests that these changes might contribute to viral escape from the host immune system rather than increasing/ adjusting the affinity to a cellular receptor as suggested in a previous study of the hcov-229e s protein 67 . we therefore consider it a major achievement that an efficient fecv rescue system could be developed in the present study. the intensity of the bands was analyzed using a chemidoc imaging system and image lab software.the innate immune response is characterized by the production of type i interferons ifn-α/β and many other pro-inflammatory cytokines . upon infection of mammalian cells with bacterial or viral pathogens an early line of defense termed the innate immune response is triggered. although rv infection is clearly able to induce an innate immune response there is abundant data demonstrating that rv can also effectively antagonize this pathway. the innate immune response is initiated by host proteins called pattern recognition receptors prrs that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps presented during the microbial infection. the adaptive immune response to rv infection has been well characterized and studies have demonstrated that cd8+ t cells play a critical role in the timely clearance of a primary infection while b cells are crucial for resistance to re-infection . approximately 21 hr later cell lysates were made and analyzed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system. the rlr mitochondrial adaptor protein mavs was also shown to be necessary for this response. rig-i is required for and mda5 contributes to ifn production in response to rv transcripts. approximately 21 hours after rna transfection cells were lysed in 100 µl of passive lysis buffer promega and an aliquot was analyzed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system promega . however in our experiments we observed that rig-i is indispensable for the ifn response to these rna samples figure 3 . much less is known about the role of innate immune signaling in protection from rv infection however. this result suggests that although input genomic dsrna is immunostimulatory nascent transcripts which were only generated under the complete reaction conditions are also capable of eliciting a robust ifn response.it is also required for programming functional adaptive immune responses and therefore coordinates the entire host immune response to infection . innate immunity is the first arm of immune response to viral infections. production of these cytokines is essential for activation of the whole immune response against the viral infection. il-18 is another member of the il-1 family that acts as an important regulator of innate and acquired immune responses. it is also involved in inflammasomes response to anthrax lethal toxin found mainly in immune cells epithelial cells and osteoblasts. the innate immune response to viruses is composed of three main classes of prrs termed the rig-i retinoic acid-inducible gene i -like receptors rlrs the toll-like receptors tlrs and the nod nucleotide oligomerization domain -like receptors nlrs . such response is crucial as it acts to suppress viral replication and spread to other cells. activation of tlr3 inhibits hcv replication suggesting that tlr3 is part of the antiviral response to the infection . inflammation has always been associated with viral infections raising the question of which viral pamps are responsible for induction of inflammatory response . the antiviral response is triggered upon the sensing of the different viral antigens by pattern recognition receptors prrs of the infected cell . interferon c interleukin 18 interleukin-1 beta receptor interleukin 1 receptor antagonist interleukin-1 beta ice protease-activating factor also known as nlrc4 interferon regulatory transcription factor lgp2 laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome tgn trans-golgi network the immune response to different pathological invasions in the human body is mediated by two arms innate and acquired immunity. il-1β was originally identified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine able to induce both local and systemic inflammation and a febrile reaction in response to infection or injury.nonetheless some ferrets have survived for several months after diagnosis and one of the authors jm has a long-term survivor of more than 3 years 7 14 16 frscv-associated disease is an immune-mediated disease and therefore treatment is aimed at suppressing the immune system suppressing the excessive inflammatory response and eliminating or reducing the systemic coronavirus through immune modulation. antioxidants may be useful to reduce the free radicals and reactive oxygen species that are produced from the inflammatory response and hyperactive immune response. sod may have an additional beneficial effect on the immune system because it can increase the ratio of cd41 to cd81 lymphocytes in cats 80 s-adenosylmethionine same and silybin are other antioxidant therapies that should be beneficial. omeprazole and famotidine have the advantage of only once-a-day administration however cimetidine also has some beneficial effects on the immune system. in addition symptomatic treatment and nutritional support can be used to try to ameliorate the clinical signs and improve the ferret s quality of life 14 16 17 immune suppression prednisolone pediapred is the main medication used to suppress the ferret s immune system 16 prednisolone suppresses both the humoral and cell-mediated immunity cmi . in animals with neurologic signs gross lesions within the nervous system were rather limited. the goal of immune modulation is to help reduce or eliminate the systemic coronavirus. immune modulators used in feline fip cases include a polyprenyl immunostimulant and interferon. melatonin also has some immune modulation effects and antiviral effects. signs of central nervous system disease include hind limb paresis or paraparesis ataxia tremors and seizures. fip is a fatal multi-systemic immune-mediated disease of cats caused by virulent mutants of fcov. interferon is another immune modulator that has been studied in feline fip 13 both feline interferon omega and human interferon alpha have been shown to inhibit feline coronavirus replication in vitro 13 32 recombinant feline interferon omega is available in some european countries and japan and has been used to treat cats with fip 19 in one uncontrolled study in japan a recombinant feline interferon omega was used with dexamethasone or oral prednisolone to treat 12 cats with suspected fip 4 older cats with the wet form of fip experienced long-term remission of greater than 2 years with this treatment 30 a recent placebo-controlled double-blind study with feline interferon omega did not show any effect on survival time or quality of life.a th1/th2 balanced or th1-biased immune response is generally associated with more effective control of viral infections. specific immune responses against the n m and e structural proteins induced by the iv formulation we next evaluated the n e and m-specific immune responses in mice that received vaccines. however the igg2a/igg1 and igg2b/igg1 ratios were 1 a th1-biased immune response in the iv vaccine group. the igg2a/igg1 and igg2b/ igg1 ratios were 1 a balanced th1-and th2-type immune response in the s protein vaccine group. however the antigen-specific humoral immune response against structural proteins n m and e other than the s protein was only detected in mice with iv. cpg oligodeoxynucleotides namely cpg which are short synthetic dna sequences consisting of unmethylated cg dinucleotides are currently being developed as vaccine adjuvants that promote th1-type immune responses 27 . serum neutralizing activity was determined using a mers-cov pseudovirus system as reported previously 15 18 . an ideal mers vaccine should induce a potent neutralizing antibody response without inducing harmful immune effects such as virus-enhanced antibodies or immunopathology. significant values are defined by p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 using iv or s protein-immunized mouse serum as the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:400. e and m were detected at their predicted sizes by iv-immunized mouse serum indicating induction of an e and m-specific immune response. as is known s protein or iv vaccines with alum adjuvant induce a th2-biased response. after the third immunization the np-specific igg response was further enhanced in mice that received the iv vaccine. robust neutralizing antibody responses were elicited by the s protein and iv combined adjuvant formulations at 6 weeks.allergy is acquired hypersensitivity reaction of immune response. it has been well established that nf-κb is essential for the regulation of inflammation and immune response and is a key transcription factor involved in the regulation of various inflammatory mediators and proinflammatory cytokines afonina et al 2017 . but the direct target of sss in the cns system is still unknown. furthermore a recent study suggested that ssa ssb and ssd regulate immune response and t helper th 1/th2 cells ratio associated with increased production of immunosuppressive mediators including il-4 and il-10 and decreased expression of pro-immune mediators such as ifn-γ and tnf-α in splenocytes wang et al 2013b . various studies recorded that sss have neuroprotective effects on cns system and are used to treat depressive-like disorders. most of the anti-inflammatory and immune regulation studies were mainly focused on ssa ssb2 and ssd. among them ssa seems to be more potency on the inhibition of cytokines expression ssd is more effective on immune suppression and ssb2 is mostly exhibiting antiviral activities. these studies indicate a complicate role of sss in pge2 release as well as the regulation of inflammatory responses. in addition the effects of sss and rb-containing tcm on cns system especially on depression have drawn great attentions over the past decades. high concentration of ssa and ssd 50 µm however stimulate inflammation by promoting pge2 secretion in rat glioma cells which is highly plausible response of these cells to high concentration of sss-induced excessive cell death. anti-inflammation anti-viral and immunoregulation effects of sss at relatively low concentration about 10 µm are most promising so that sss can be considered as potential therapeutic options for the treatment of diseases in which inflammation is major driving factor including but not limit to respiratory system infectious diseases viral hepatitis fatty liver diseases liver fibrosis and atherosclerosis. to date although rb extract and rb containing tcm formulas are widely used for the treatment of various diseases including chronic hepatic inflammation and viral hepatitis overdose-induced acute or accumulation-related chronic hepatotoxicity and other digestive system diseases have also been documented bermejo et al 2002 wang et al 2010a .the immune system plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of rsv disease and rsv is associated with the exacerbation of airway inflammation castro et al 2008 . cx3cl1 was from r d systems. the mechanism we propose involves the combined role of rsv g and f glycoproteins in hijacking the newborn immune system to impair viral clearance. using iav-activated neonatal plasmacytoid dcs pdcs we recently showed that type i ifn-dependent neonatal th1 cell differentiation is induced by the allogeneic immune response zhang et al 2014a . in primary rsv infection in humans and mice a type i immune response including nk cells th1 cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls which act as important sources of ifn-g is essential for viral clearance openshaw and chiu 2013 . this is often thought to be associated with th2 cell responses. output data files were further analyzed using the rosetta resolver gene expression data analysis system. similarly rsv-activated neonatal pdcs induced a predominantly ifn-g th1 cell response that was associated with a mild il-4 th2 cell responses figures 2d-2f . this was associated with decreased apc functions of pdcs hla-dr and cd80 but not the ifn-a response figure s3b . an unbalanced and dysregulated t cell response to hrsv limits viral clearance and is reported to cause immunopathology in the respiratory tract. altogether these data demonstrate that the nbreg cells can be specifically activated by rsv and may control the th1 cell responses in an il-10-dependent manner. the il-10 production by nbreg cells was mainly associated with the infection of the cell although additional mechanisms such as tlr activation might contribute to the amplification of the antiinflammatory response.interactions of virus-encoded proteins with human innate immune pathways the effect of host-cell surface molecules in virus binding and entry the role of viral protein nuclear localization in the host cell response and the flavivirus replication dynamics within multiple immune systems have all been considered as host-pathogen interaction events that may regulate viral virulence or attenuation and the subsequent disease severity. conditions such hyperglycemia and cellular insulinopenia may also impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions leading to a status of reduced acquired immune response that was linked to about 60% increased risk of pneumonia-related complications and hospitalization . in general although the etiological relationship between chronic comorbidities and severity of flavivirus diseases is yet to be fully elucidated it may be reasonable to suggest that in infected patients chronic conditions may synergistically attenuate both the innate and adaptive immune systems . impairment of the innate immune system-that mediates the host defense to infection-render individuals more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases and severe illnesses . these metabolic syndrome related diseases may impair the immune system to increase the level and duration of viremia and facilitate the passage of neurotropic flavivirus across the blood-brain barrier to predispose patients to neurologic complications . however some mechanisms and etiological factors underlying inter-individual variations in response to flavivirus infections have been identified. patients with asthma normally exhibit altered th1 and th2 responses . datasets were few or unavailable for jev zikv and yfv. according to the 2009 who classification system denv patients can be clinically classified as with probable dengue dengue with warning signs or severe dengue . this deviates from the 1997 who classification system categorizing patients as with df dhf or dss. in fact the metabolic syndrome related chronic conditions are linked to endothelial dysfunction attenuation of anti-inflammatory responses and a generation of a pro-inflammatory state features that are also common in many infectious disorders . a few studies of wnv and jev infections and responses to yfv vaccination have also explored the role of chronic comorbidities in the prognosis of infections.the effects of the indirect autoimmune response are frequently detectable before the tumor or its direct consequences. its frameshifting is not a constitutive process but is regulated over a 10-fold response window depending on carbon source. another ca 25 proteins including transcription activators are used to build the secretion system. expression in heterologous systems 513 514 and in homologous systems 98 406 515 have revealed differences between bacteria and eukaryotic systems in optimal spacer lengths or within eukaryotes for specific 3 stimulators in one case with implications for frameshift directionality. one class is the type iii secretion systems -the use of transcriptional slippage in expression of several of these is described below. while this type iii secretion system mechanism is different from phage lambda gt ribosomal frameshifting expression of the yersinia pestis and y pseudotuberculosis yopn-tyea fusion protein related to function of its type iii system is also at the ribosomal frameshifting level 330 331 . after it is transmitted by fleas to warm-blooded animals and the needle part of the type iii secretion system senses contact with a host cell a signaling system influences five proteins to no longer inhibit secretion of the effector proteins that reorganize the host cell. the ice element encodes components responsible for a complex system of activators and repressors for quorum sensing and also components of the excision system responsive to it 201 . the protein products of the paraneoplastic mammalian antigen-like genes pnma3 and pnma5 ma3 and ma5 genes are targets of an autoimmune response triggered by the ectopic expression of antigens in tumor cells 225 . however while the frameshift product has a distinct impact on fitness the reason is not understood despite extensive work on the complicated system involved 331 . its loss leads to changes in the kinetics of the global host response including increases in inflammatory apoptotic and t lymphocyte-signaling pathways 39 . vector systems where both products can be assayed in the same tube such as firefly and renilla luciferase 659 have proved popular though fluorescence reporters e g 660 661 have been gaining ground.the immune response to 2019-ncov in humans awaits characterization but human immune responses against other coronaviruses have been investigated. in conclusion the use of available information related to sars-cov epitopes in conjunction with bionformatic predictions points to specific regions of 2019-ncov which have a high likelihood of being recognized by human immune responses . b cell epitope predictions were carried out using the 2019-ncov surface glycoprotein nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and membrane glycoprotein sequences which as described above were found to be the main protein targets for b cell responses to other coronaviruses. vaccination strategies designed to target the immune response toward these conserved epitope regions could generate immunity that is not only crossprotective across betacoronaviruses but also relatively resistant to ongoing virus evolution the corresponding peptide sets are being synthesized and will be made available for use by the scientific community upon request to the lji team. because of the overall high level of sequence similarity of sars-cov and 2019-ncov we infer that the same regions that are dominant in sars-cov have high likelihood to also be dominant in 2019-ncov even if the actual sequences are different. in terms of the host in which the various b and t cell epitopes were recognized table 1b most epitopes either b or t were defined in humans or murine systems. in the case of the spike glycoprotein fig 2a we identify five regions of potential interest residues 274-306 510-586 587-628 784-803 and 870-893 all representing regions associated with high immune response rates. the observation that many b and t cell epitopes are highly conserved between 2019-ncov and sars-cov is important. overall the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and membranederived epitopes were most conserved 8/10 and 2/3 respectively had ≥ 85% identity with 2019-ncov . the orf1ab and surface glycoprotein epitopes were moderately conserved 3/7 and 10/23 respectively had ≥ 85% identity with 2019-ncov and orf 3a epitopes were the least conserved. of the ten regions identified six had 90% or more identity with 2019-ncov two were between 80-89% identical and two had lower but still appreciable homology 69% and 78% . in conclusion sars-cov is the closest related virus to 2019-ncov for which a significant number of epitopes has been defined in humans and other species and that also causes human disease with lethal outcomes.however in some circumstances opportunistic viral pathogens like the human coronaviruses can avoid the immune response and cause more severe respiratory diseases vareille et al 2011 or even spread to other tissues including the central nervous system cns where they could induce other types of pathologies mcgavern and kang 2011 . several infections of epithelial cells including those that involve coronaviruses are selflimited and the infection remains local as the virus will be cleared by the immune system in the respiratory tract with minimal clinical consequences. this immune response was significantly increased after infection by virus variants which harbor mutations in the surface viral glycoprotein s consequent of viral persistent infection of human neural cells jacomy et al 2010 and which induce glutamate excitotoxicity brison et al 2014 . like several human viruses listed previously in the present review coronaviruses that infect human beings are naturally neuroinvasive and neurotropic and potentially neurovirulent as a result of misdirected host immune responses virus-induced neuroimmunopathology and/or viral replication which directly induces damage to cns cells virus-induced neuropathology . based on several pieces of evidence presented herein we hypothesize that neuroinvasive coronaviruses could participate in the damage of the human cns as a result of misdirected host immune responses virus-induced neuroimmunopathology and/or viral replication which directly induces damage to cns cells virus-induced neuropathology . moreover this data in association with the observation that autoreactive t cells were able to recognize both viral and myelin antigens in ms patients but not in controls during infection by hcov-oc43 and hcov-229e boucher et al 2007 talbot et al 1996 suggest that the immune response may participate in the induction or exacerbation of neuropathologies such as ms in genetically or otherwise susceptible individuals fig 3b . virus-cell interactions are always important in the regulation of cell response to infection. furthermore knowledge of mechanisms and consequences of coronavirus interactions with the nervous system is essential to better understand potentially pathological consequences and design intervention strategies that are appropriate to encephalitis or exacerbations of other types of neurological diseases for which a given virus is involved. infection of human monocytes/macrophages by hcov-229e and hcov-oc43 was reported collins 2002 desforges et al 2007 and infection by hcov-229e of human mesel-lemoine et al 2012 and murine dendritic cells expressing the human aminopeptidase n wentworth et al 2005 suggests that hcov may on one hand manipulate the immune system and on the other hand use dendritic cells to disseminate to other tissues including the cns where they could be associated with other type of pathologies. using molecular sequencing it was rapidly shown that this new respiratory coronavirus was genetically different than sars-cov and it is now recognized that the new epidemic is caused by a new coronavirus from the genus betacoronavirus zaki et al 2012 that was first named hcov-emc for human coronavirus -erasmus medical center human betacoronavirus 2c and ncov or ncov for novel coronavirus and that is now known under the official name mers-cov: middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus coleman and frieman 2013 de groot et al 2013 which is the etiologic agent of a severe lower respiratory tract infection that resembles sars and which can be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and possible renal failure . in recent years several coronavirus accessory proteins including the tgev protein 7 and the mhv ns2 protein have been extensively studied and are now considered as important viral factors of virulence implicated in pathogenesis as they are able to counteract host-cell response associated with the activation of rnase l and the type 1 interferon response cruz et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2012 zhao et al 2011 . the fact that hcov-229e could only infect partially immune-compromised transgenic mice lassnig et al 2005 suggests that being an opportunistic pathogen hcov-229e could take advantage of an immune-suppressed environment and disseminate to the cns within susceptible individuals.however for several reasons many virus vector systems are still limited in their ability to induce a broad and long-lasting antiviral immune response capable to prevent hiv infection and/or to reduce viral load. an important prerequisite for the initiation of immune responses in vivo is the translocation of antigens from peripheral sites into secondary lymphoid organs zinkernagel et al 1997 . furthermore there is growing need to develop therapeutic vaccines which may boost specific immune response to persistent viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus hiv . however the major bottle-neck in the development of new and effective vaccines is the delivery of antigens to cellular components of the immune system that initiate protective antiviral immunity. nevertheless high doses of recombinant adenovirus vectors have to be applied to induce antiviral immune response most probably because they target antigens mainly to nonlymphoid organs such as the liver krebs et al 2005 . since most patients develop t cell responses against the hiv proteins env gag or nef betts et al 2001 addo et al 2003 a broadly applicable vaccine should elicit immune responses at least against these three immmunodominant antigens. mhv also allows for the usage of a collection of well characterized inbred and transgenic mice and a variety of established immunological techniques indispensable for the analysis of vectorinduced immune responses. incorporation of dc-activating chemokines or factors prolonging dc survival into genetic vaccines has been shown to enhance the immune response against recombinant rabies virus pinto et al 2003 or hiv gp120 biragyn et al 2002 . a recent study in untreated hiv-1 infected individuals revealed that dc-based vaccination can elicit potent immune responses against immunodeficiency viruses in humans lu et al 2004 . furthermore mhv is one of the best-studied coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo. these results indicate that coronavirus-based vector systems might be useful for heterologous gene expression especially for longer and multiple genes. although immunogenic peptides or naked nucleic acid can elicit immune responses against hiv antigens the use of viral vectors represents a superior strategy to deliver hiv antigens and/or immunostimulatory cytokines to specific target cells.coronavirus suppressing host immunity has been demonstrated however the alterations of immune system in patients with covid-2019 are not yet well understood. based on our findings we suggested that the early interventions of host immune system and gut microbiota are necessary for covid-2019 patients with refractory hypoxia. moreover gut microbiota was able to modulate the immune response and played an important role in immune-mediated diseases suggesting a vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance 14 . we discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with covid-2019. in conclusion we discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with covid-2019. host immune response is essential for the clearance of coronavirus infection and the balance between coronavirus and host immunity is key to viral pathogenesis and will ultimately determine infection outcome 1 . doi doi: medrxiv preprint microbiota and gut microbiota homeostasis is modulated by the immune system 12 . in this study we aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels. coronaviruses encode numerous viral gene products to evade and suppress host immune response such as sars-associated coronavirus nonstructural protein 1 which is able to inhibit host interferon-dependent antiviral signaling 2 as well as another sars coronavirus protein named open reading frame-9b which can suppress mitochondria of immune cells 3 . it was also demonstrated that the immunosuppressed rhesus macaques had markedly increased mers-coronavirus replication in the lung suggesting the inability in virus clearance 8 multiple studies have demonstrated the interaction between immune system and gut all rights reserved. this is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-ncov infection admitted to renmin hospital of wuhan university wuhan china from january 31 2020 to february 6 2020. all patients were diagnosed and classified based on the diagnosis all rights reserved. to the best of our knowledge this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of covid-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.these novel findings may be of relevance for other viral infections and can possibly be translated in order to find therapies for their associated diseases immune system activation has also been proven for other viroporins 53 . cells have evolved mechanisms to sense these imbalances in ion concentrations as a danger signal and consequently trigger the innate immune system. the repercussions of this system in viral pathogenesis or disease outcome are currently being explored. il-1b is an early response highly inflammatory cytokine that is tightly regulated. this increased pathogenesis was mainly dependent on an exacerbated host response to the viral infection . pro-il-1b levels were analyzed by western blotting using a goat anti mouse il-1b/il-1f2 antibody r d systems . data were acquired with an abi prism 7000 sequence detection system applied biosystems and analyzed using abi prism 7000 sds v1 0 software. accordingly the enhanced inflammatory response triggered by e protein ion channel proficient viruses may be a major pathology inducer. all these results indicate that the presence of e protein ic activity correlates with the activation of the inflammasome and an acute inflammatory response that is deleterious for lung tissue. il-1b enhances the production of tnf and il-6 is stimulated by both cytokines providing an integrated amplified inflammatory response detrimental for pulmonary function . in this study we have shown that sars-cov e protein ic activity is a virulence determinant influencing inflammatory responses including those inflammasome-derived pulmonary damage and disease outcome. one of the key early-response cytokines driving proinflammatory activity in bronchoalveolar spaces is il-1b .doi doi: medrxiv preprint adaptive immune system is specific and memorizes the pathogens including two arms the antibody and t cell responses. a well co-ordinated innate and adaptive immune response may rapidly control of the virus while a failed immune response leads to viral spreading cytokine storm and high mortality . host immune responses on some extent determine both protection and pathogenesis to the respiratory viral infections . our study depicts a high-resolution transcriptome atlas of lung resident immune subsets in response to sars-cov-2 infections. together our data showed an increased recruitment of immune cells to the lung in response to sars-cov-2 infection and that the lung immune cell compartments differed between mild and severe covid-19 patients. doi 23 20026690 doi: medrxiv preprint cells formed in the mildly infected patients support the notion that a rapid and robust adaptive immune response is potentially critical for controlling covid-19. robust antibody responses were developed in severely infected sars patients . memory t cell responses are induced and maintained in sars-cov infected subjects . we assumed that it might be related to bystander activation induced by hyper inflammation or a delayed response to the infection in severe covid-19. we propose that characterizing the earlier immune events and longitudinal analysis of immune dynamics of the infected patients may help gain more insights. the immunopathogenesis of hcovs-induced respiratory distress syndrome may involve deranged interferon production hyper-inflammatory response and cytokine storms inefficient or delayed induction of neutralizing antibody and specific t cell responses . thus we presented the fresh evidence that cd8 + t cell response likely holds the key for successful viral control in covid-19 patients.in summary in the 2019-ncov epidemic the overall response of china and the international community is faster than it was for sars-cov. at the same time cooperation within the medical system enables scientific research results to be used in clinical diagnosis and treatment in a timely manner and serves as the scientific basis for the government s response. nevertheless the epidemic response was generally satisfactory . back in 2003 china built the xiaotangshan temporary hospital in 6 days with its construction starting as late as 158 days after the first case was reported indicating that the response to the spread of sars-cov was far slower than for 2019-ncov. it remains to be seen whether these measures can quickly control the spread of 2019-ncov. on the same day who announced that 2019-ncov constitutes a public health emergency of international concern pheic which noted that this elusive disease is more dangerous than the one in 2003. the chinese government also made a series of significant responses in a very short period of time including the establishment of a leading group of experts for epidemic response the construction of a number of temporary hospitals 24e26 the deployment of medical staff and the implementation of a comprehensive national epidemic prevention policy . making advance preparations for a pandemic may bring us significant short-term benefits such as supporting basic health care encouraging research and development strengthening interregional cooperation and emergency response systems and biosafety management and promoting the balanced development of health and security of the world in general. currently there are still more than 3000 new confirmed cases of 2019-ncov infection daily. in 2019 however real-time information of the 2019-ncov epidemic was transmitted in real-time through various channels throughout the country like wechat and weibo like apps. as noted in fig 1c during the 2019-ncov epidemic most of the government s major epidemic prevention measures were also implemented quickly after the disease was diagnosed. the 2019-ncov epidemic has challenged the limits of our ability to handle it. the level 1 emergency response to major public health emergencies was implemented and comprehensive epidemic prevention began.there is currently no vaccine to protect against 2019-ncov. the knowledge of peptide vaccine is used to identify b-cell and t-cell epitopes which can induce specific immune responses . b cell epitopes are part of allergen which come in interaction with b lymphocytes to induce immune response. a novel coronavirus ncov is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is a coronavirus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in wuhan china. prevention of viral diseases by vaccination purposes for controlled induction of protective immune responses against viral pathogens such as small pox hepatitis etc. the 2019-ncov is spreading from person to person in china and limited spread among close contacts has been detected in some countries outside china. two complete virus genomes hku-sz-002a and hku-sz-005b are sequenced from 2019-ncov infected patients . according to lu et al 2020 genome sequence of 2019-ncov is closely related with 88% identity to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome sars -like coronaviruses bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21 and genetically distinct from sars-cov. these two t cell epitopes can stimulate immunogenic response after administration inside the human body. cd4+ t-cell receptor responses against concerned nonstructural protein ns4 protein are done by using peptide binding to mhc class ii molecules software using mhc ii binding prediction tool in iedb analysis resource including a consensus approach which combines nnalign smm-align and combinatorial library methods. linear t-cell epitopes for mhc-i binding for nonstructural protein ns4 protein in coronavirus are recognized by consensus methods using various methods such as artificial neural network ann stabilized matrix method smm and scoring matrices derived from combinatorial peptide libraries comblib from tools for mhc -i binding prediction methods of immune epitope database iedb www iedb org . the copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer-reviewed is the .many of them will be recognized and removed by our 14 innate immune system. in contrast there were less than 20 viruses attached 9 to the cell surfaces within the same amount of time in the 2019-ncov system. doi doi: biorxiv preprint are cleared up by the innate immune system. without surprise the figure shows that although almost all 2 viruses were attached to the cell surfaces by the end of both simulations the kinetic 3 process in the sars system is much faster than the 2019-ncov system which is resulted 4 from the difference in the association rate between receptors and their corresponding s-5 proteins. a relatively fast viral binding rat was adopted in the first 7 system to represent the binding process of sars while a relatively slow rate was 8 adopted in the second to represent the binding process of 2019-ncov. a relatively fast viral binding rat was adopted in the first system to represent the binding process of sars whil relatively slow rate was adopted in the second to represent the binding process of 2019-7 ncov. as a result the 6 comparison of calculated probabilities of association for both systems is plotted in figure 7 2a 8 the figure shows that probability of association between ace2 and the s-protein 9 from 2019-ncov is remarkably lower than the probability of association between ace2 10 and the s-protein from sars. a relatively fast rate 25 of association between receptors and s-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the first 26 system to represent the binding process of sars while a relatively slow rate of 27 association between receptors and s-proteins on viral surfaces was adopted in the second 28 system to represent the binding process of 2019-ncov. on the other side in order to avoid viral spread our innate immune system triggers 29 inflammatory signaling pathways in the infected cells . two specific simulation systems were compared. as shown in b we found that the first stage in the simulation of 2019-ncov red 8 curve is longer than the simulation of sars black curve while the level of free virus 9 at the end of the first period in 2019-ncov is relatively higher than the corresponding 10 level of free virus in sars. the 3 figure suggests that the dynamics of the system can be divided into three stages a .however just as pathogens evade the immune system of the host they could use such defense mechanisms against ros generate by nanomaterials. of course some bacteria are certainly adapted to favor damage like encapsulated bacteria that prevent phagocytic cells from seeing them and therefore prevent their immediate elimination by the innate immune system of the host . adequate education is necessary for the guaranteed sanitation of overpopulated public places where pathogens can be developed good nutrition of the population to guarantee the human immune system and prevention to avoid the evolution of microbes in the greenhouses of farmers where biodiversity decreases . the expression of these genes is not observed in a doxyr mutant which indicates that oxyr is essential for this response. however the excessive growth of algae is detrimental to aquatic systems . other systems composed of three photoactive semiconductors have been reported for disinfection process as the cds/cuwo4/tio2 system . the coexistence of the ag and agx in the ternary system helps to extend the light-response range to the visible light region due to the surface plasmon resonance of the ag nanoparticles and the as-sensitized agx . the most recurrent use is the removal of bacteria in aqueous systems . the dose of the hybrid system was 0 6 g/l as shown in ag nanoparticles on its surface. in this way the mutant microorganisms serve to study the response of the specific physiological function . however only a few tio2 coupled systems have been studied for photocatalytic disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms. naturally heterogeneous systems are more affected due to the contraction of direct contact with microbial and particle agglomeration.this was the second 2019-ncov case to be confirmed outside of china being identified between the two cases from thailand . as this virus clusters with various bat betacoronavirus it is reasonable to deduce that bats are the native host for the 2019-ncov. in december 2019 a new coronavirus 2019-ncov which is about 70% similar to sars-cov was discovered in the central chinese city of wuhan with 545 cases in 25 provinces being diagnosed fig 1 a january 22 2020 . he remained febrile until 14 january and was eventually tested as positive for 2019-ncov on 15 january 9 he became afebrile on the same day and was discharged home where he remains stable. importantly such symptoms appear to persist longer in cases of 2019-ncov infection than in most cases of uncomplicated influenza. infections of healthcare workers and family clusters suggest that 2019-ncov has the ability to spread from human to human. many of the 2019-ncov infected people had either worked at or frequently visited a seafood market in wuhan. so far both cases are recovering well in the negative pressure isolation facilities at the bamrasnaradura institute in thailand and may be discharged soon 7 8 in addition one case of 2019-ncov was confirmed in a male patient in his thirties in japan who was staying in wuhan during late december 2019 to early january 2020 and developed fever on 3 january. now with the emergence of a novel coronavirus cov from wuhan china tentatively named as 2019-ncov by the world health organization -who 3 4 similar clinical diagnostic and management guidance are required. considering that the original source of the 2019-ncov is very likely related to a wild animal additional strict laws to limit wildlife markets should be made otherwise more emerging zoonoses from wild animals will occurred in the near future. faers cases were matched to cdc meningococcal disease surveillance data from the national notifiable diseases surveillance system when possible for confirmation of infection serogroup 1 and antibiotic susceptibility testing. a full genome phylogenetic analysis of this 2019-ncov indicates that it is closely related to bat sars-like cov fig 1 compatible with a zoonotic origin for this virus similar to sars-cov and mers-cov 5 two cases have now been confirmed to date in thailand.however there are currently no effective medications against 2019-ncov. in addition the application of melatonin may prolong patients survival time which may provide a chance for patients immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. in december 2019 the third pathogenic hcov named 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was found in wuhan china. there is an urgent need for the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies for 2019-ncov outbreak. doi doi: medrxiv preprint groups are working on the development of vaccines to prevent and treat the 2019-ncov but effective vaccines are not available yet. protein sequence alignment analyses indicated that the 2019-ncov was most evolutionarily conserved with sars-cov supplementary table s2 . our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-ncov outbreak. the 2019-ncov shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity 79 7% with sars-cov among the 6 other known pathogenic hcovs revealing conserved evolutionary relationship between 2019-ncov and sars-cov figure 2a . specifically the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-ncov are two evolutionarily conserved regions with sequence identities of 96% and 89 6% respectively compared to sars- table s2 . to date 7 pathogenic hcovs figure 2a and 2b have been found : i 2019-ncov sars-cov mers-cov hcov-oc43 and hcov-hku1 are b genera and ii hcov-nl63 and hcov-229e are a genera. as of february 02 2020 there have been over 14 000 cases with 300 deaths for the 2019-ncov pandemic link furthermore human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts . a recent study showed that 2019-ncov is able to utilize ace2 as an entry receptor in ace2-expressing cells suggesting potential drug targets for therapeutic development.they are essential to the metabolism growth and development of all cells and tissues and are part of the processes that regulate our immune and neurological systems. it also plays key roles in physiological and pathological processes such as embryogenesis immune responses angiogenesis tumor cell invasion and metastasis . other natural non-covalent heteroatom-rich systems are based on terpene or polyphenol scaffolds. simultaneously the hydroxamate moiety is an effective planar bidentate o o metal chelating system. over-activity of the renineangiotensin system in the brain has been implicated in the development and maintenance of hypertension. much more significant response was stimulated by application of a mixed prodrug which structure was disulfide based combination of two thiol inhibitors each directed towards a certain enzyme either apn or nep . using specific agents described above it was demonstrated that apa and apn are involved in the metabolism of angiotensin ii and iii respectively within this system. it may also have an important function in early events of hiv infection and thus serum activity of this enzyme may be useful as a surrogate marker for hiv infection and response to chemotherapy . in biological systems their primary peptide substrates include a wide variety of neuropeptides and hormones . bestatin has been extensively investigated in biological systems both in vitro and in vivo which resulted in discovery of several interesting properties of this compound such as ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells anti-angiogenic anti-malarial or immunomodulatory effects . the challenge will be to discover inhibitors with selectivity not only for specific enzyme types so as to avoid off-target effects on other systems but can be delivered to block specific functions or physiological roles of a particular aminopeptidase since each enzyme often performs a variety of defined and ancillary roles. most probably the combination of three electronegative groups that are involved in the metal ions coordination namely the aromatic nitrogen of the pyridine ring the carbonyl moiety in position 2 and a heteroatom of the thiazole forms a system essential for the tight binding.these results could be taken to suggest that exon may modulate innate immune responses but tgev nsp14 remains to be characterized biochemically and for now one can only speculate about the level of exon activity of this particular mutant. unfortunately no information is available on the enzymatic activity or replication fidelity of the two tgev exon zf1 mutants which would be required to better understand the interesting phenotype of these mutants and their capability to modulate innate immune responses. interactions with the host s innate immune system have been suggested to co-determine the phenotype of exon-knockout cov mutants kindler and thiel 2014 becares et al 2016 case et al 2018 . in our opinion technical variations are unlikely to explain these viability differences: with the exception of tgev exon knockout mutants were commonly launched by electroporation of in vitro produced full-length rna into the cytosol of bhk-21 cells thus providing an equal environment for the first critical rounds of replication in a cell line that is known to be compromised in its innate immune response lam et al 2005 habjan et al 2008 . using a replicon system for the alphacoronavirus tgev genome replication and sg mrna synthesis were found to be only modestly reduced upon mutagenesis of exon active site residues becares et al 2016 . as covs employ a range of innate immune evasion mechanisms kindler and thiel 2014 it is difficult to study the importance of any single mechanism in a straightforward manner as other innate immune antagonists will continue to operate in cells infected with mutants lacking one particular immune evasion function. this was attributed to a reduced accumulation of viral dsrna an important pathogenassociated molecular pattern pamp that is recognized by innate immune sensors which triggered a decrease of ifn-β mrna synthesis and of ifn-induced immune factors in cell culture becares et al 2016 . additionally a second zf1 mutation his-to-cys at the position of the fourth zncoordinating residue h229 did not strongly affect tgev rna synthesis or progeny titers but was reported to trigger a weaker tgev-induced antiviral response. it has been proposed that cov nsp14 by virtue of its exon activity may counteract innate responses by degrading dsrna replication intermediates in a similar manner as documented for the exon domain of the arenavirus nucleoprotein hastie et al 2011 russier et al 2014 . a genetic screening approach in a yeast system revealed that the c-terminal domain of nsp14 exhibits n7-guanine -methyltransferase n7-mtase activity chen et al 2009 . as summarized in the previous paragraph tgev exon active site mutants were non-viable see also above but an nsp14 mutant carrying a zf1 mutation h229c close to the interaction region with nsp10 was reported to accumulate less dsrna in infected cells and trigger a weaker antiviral response becares et al 2016 . this feature which in itself has been proposed to be an innate immune evasion strategy would potentially complicate access of nsp14 to viral dsrna substrates.antibodies are the products of humoral immune response after infection with viruses. after the virus infects the organism the immune system carries on the immune defense to the virus and produces the specific antibody. generally speaking the immune response of pathogenic microorganisms is usually stimulated by the rise of igm after infection igg usually appears 1-2 weeks after igm and has been rising and maintaining high levels in the body for a long time. in the early stage of this epidemic due to the insufficient production of nucleic acid detection kits and the high requirement of technical norms for nucleic acid detection the application of nucleic acid testing as a diagnostic standard was limited when the body s immune system produces antibodies the clinical signs and symptoms is obvious the virus is likely to decline without being detected. as a new infectious disease while the detection of nucleic acid cannot be used widely specific antibodies to 2019-ncov can be used to determine whether the patient has been recently infected with 2019-ncov or not. it has been reported that serum samples from 5 patients were detected by self-made 2019-ncov igg and igm elisa kits and the antigen could cover 92% of the 2019-ncov np amino acids 13 . the ct value of 2019-ncov nucleic acid test results should be interpreted according all rights reserved. however how the 2019-ncov antibody produced and changed during covid-19 progression is still unclear. the copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer-reviewed is 2019-ncov is highly infectious and the population is generally susceptible to 2019-ncov.the most common symptoms after infection include fever fatigue dry cough and muscle pain with expiratory dyspnoea occurring in more than half of patients 14 . it is necessary to use a fast and convenient method to realize the rapid diagnosis of 2019-ncov infection. at present the main diagnostic method is to detect 2019-ncov nucleic acid by real-time quantitative fluorescent pcr. coronaviruses usually cause respiratory digestive and nervous system diseases in humans and animals 1 .when mers-cov infection is subclinical or less severe humoral immune responses may be weak delayed short-lived or undetectable . combined treatments which reduce viral replication and the host immune response to it are likely to be valuable developments . downregulation of innate immune response mediators associated with some of these disorders may be related to the severity of mers . because airway immune responses may be key to preventing the establishment of human mers-cov infection localised deposition of an aerosolised vaccine could prove useful . nevertheless a much needed therapeutic toolbox is being developed and in this process we are learning more about how covs cause disease how they confound our immune responses where they come from and how to prevent and treat their respiratory infections . those with mild or subclinical mers still develop cd8 + t-cell responses and survivors of more severe mers including those who do not mount an antibody response develop both cd8 + and cd4 + t-cell responses . extensive inflammation and immune evasion are hallmarks of severe disease ascribed to covs . mers can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure requiring intensive supportive care . severe mers occurs most frequently among those with comorbidities including diabetes mellitus cirrhosis and others affecting respiratory renal and cardiac systems . difficulty identifying a useful diagnostic antibody response in mild and subclinical disease means seroprevalence studies likely under-report the history of mers-cov mers-cov specific cd8 + testing may be helpful . the spike protein and rbd elicit neutralising antibody responses and have been employed as the payload for a number of platforms including dna vaccines modified vaccinia virus ankara measles virus and human- and chimpanzee-adenovirus-based vectors . travel-related cases continue to challenge the rest of the world s surveillance and response capabilities and we need more data to understand unexplained primary transmission.this indicates that neither the genetic modification nor the presence of iptg influences the innate immune response in homogenously transgenic haec cultures replication in those cultures in which gfp-directed shrna had been induced by iptg figure 6b . although protocols for the generation of transgenic airway epithelium for various purposes have been described thus far there have been no reports describing whether lentivirus modification of well-differentiated haec cultures alters the host innate immune response and/or susceptibility to viral infection. as a proof-of-principle we assessed whether the host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation via inducible short hairpin sh rna-mediated knockdown and determined whether this affected the innate immune response or the susceptibility to viral infection by two common cold viruses. however it also indicates that our results are not cell-type dependent further asserting the functionality of our transgenic system as a whole. currently both the upper and lower airways can be recapitulated in vitro by using this cell culture system. to represent different areas of the pulmonary epithelium different cell types can be cultured in the system. however in order to fully utilize the potential of this culture system it must be made amenable to genetic modification. nonetheless since we demonstrate that an inducible lentiviral system is operational post-differentiation alternative methods of host gene modifications can now be explored. since the distinctive cellular composition of well-differentiated haec cultures is essential to all virus-host interaction studies the morphology of transgenic and naïve cultures must be interchangeable to preserve the functionality of the culture system. in order to determine whether our genetic modification influences the host innate immune response in transgenic haec cultures we treated both naïve and homogenously transgenic cultures shgfp1 shgfp2 and shscr with exogenous poly i:c as a proxy for viral infection after 6-day pre-treatment with 0 or 2 mm iptg to induce both mrna and protein knockdown of gfp 24 h post poly i:c treatment we assessed the expression level of mxa mrna transcripts revealing similar gene expression levels in both naïve and transgenic cultures regardless of shrna construct and iptg treatment conditions figure 6a . to circumvent these limitations we aimed to establish an inducible lentiviral system for gene knockdown in haec cultures. furthermore such a system allows for the integration of both transgene and shrna scaffolds for over expression and/or knockdown of both host and viral factors .a strong public health surveillance system to guide the response to the outbreak is important in the face of a lack of effective therapeutics or vaccines. as of february 17 2020 there were 72 436 confirmed cases of 2019-ncov in china of whom 1868 have died with a mortality rate of 2 6% . at the present time it is difficult to say whether or not the response could have been faster than it actually was as this corresponds to the time when work began on viral sequencing. in response to the outbreak of pneumonia caused by the sars-cov-2 china has activated level i public health emergency response for the entire country. identifying or developing novel drug treatment options as soon as possible is critical for the response to the sars-cov-2 outbreak. big data and artificial intelligence systems are tools that can be used to fully integrate the information conduct comprehensive research and analyze public health risks. though the respiratory systems is a primary target of sars-cov-2 bioinformatic analysis of single-cell transcriptomes datasets of lung esophagus gastric ileum and colon reveal that the digestive system is also a potential route of entry for covid-19 as ace2 was not only highly expressed in lung at2 cells esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon . before 2019 there were six covs that could infect humans and cause respiratory disease. from the lessons learned during the sars and now the sars-cov-2 epidemics we can nearly provide a roadmap for the response to future outbreaks. the earliest patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan ultimately caused the epidemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 covid-2019 . at present seven products including the sars-cov-2 nucleic acid detection kit fluorescent pcr method and the sars-cov-2 nucleic acid sequencing system have been approved on an emergency basis by the national medical products administration. the novel coronavirus pneumonia emergency response epidemiology team of the chinese cdc reported the epidemiology characteristics of 44 672 confirmed cases as of february 11 2020. among the confirmed 44 672 cases 74 7% in hubei province 51 4% were male and 80 9% were mild or moderate cases.we hypothesized that solvent-accessible amino-acid residues on s proteins would be undergoing higher rates of mutations compared to buried residues and regions that are occluded by glycans which are unable to be targeted by host immune responses. the wuhan 2019-ncov possesses a total of 22 n-linked glycan sites compared to 23 on sars with 18 of these sites being in common. investigation of the host immune response to viruses in their natural reservoirs may offer a route to understanding why coronavirus glycosylation does not reach the density of other viruses such as hiv-1. these extensive post-translational modifications often mask immunogenic protein epitopes from the host humoral immune system by occluding them with host-derived glycans 21 22 . to demonstrate that the presence of glycosylation plays a major role in the immune response to these different glycoproteins we studied the glycome of several biomedically important coronaviruses and compared their glycan compositions in a structural context. doi doi: biorxiv preprint hiv-1 env is a prototypic viral class i fusion protein that exhibits extensive surface glycosylation resulting in an effective glycan shield to aid evasion from the host adaptive immune response 25 52 . this notion is further reflected in terms of glycosylation with all of the glycan sites conserved on the s2 subunit between sars and 2019-ncov whereas the s1 subunit exhibits glycan site additions and deletions si fig 7 . cov s proteins are the largest class i viral fusion proteins known 15 and are extensively glycosylated with sars and mers s glycoproteins both encoding 69 n-linked glycan sequons per trimeric spike with 2019-ncov containing 66 sites. mers s binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 dpp4 18 whereas sars s 19 and 2019-ncov 20 utilize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ace2 as a host cellular receptor. samples were resuspended in 0 1% formic acid prior to analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using an easy-nlc 1200 system with the same amino-acid sequence were compared to determine the relative quantitation of glycoforms at each specific n-linked glycan site. although it is difficult to directly compare viruses in terms of immunogenic responses on the one hand sars and mers coronaviruses readily elicit neutralizing antibodies following infection or immunization . furthermore likely targets for the majority of antibodies targeting the spike are located on s1 resulting in greater levels of immune pressure upon this subunit.coronaviruses seem to have developed mechanisms to overcome the host innate immune response including the interferon response a major component of innate immunity. since actively dividing lymphocytes are a major cell target of sars-cov sars-cov n may decelerate lymphocyte proliferation and therefore interfere with immune system function . it is important to remember though that this translational shutoff could also simply be the host cell s response to the infection. a mammalian two-hybrid system which is performed in vivo so that viral proteins will adopt their native state and therefore be more likely to interact in a biologically accurate manner confirmed that n-m protein interactions occur in vivo . sars-cov infection causes a highly restricted immunoglobulin g-dominated antibody response that is directed most frequently and predominantly at the nucleocapsid . it was recently noted however that these studies all used vaccinia-based expression systems where overexpression of viral membrane proteins may lead to release in microvesicles complicating the interpretation of virus-like particle vlp experiments . this inhibition of the interferon response likely contributes to the pathogenesis of sars-cov. sars-n protein has also been shown to cause cytoskeletal changes in response to a different type of cell stress namely serum deprivation . the ctd of sars-n aa 251-422 is also responsible for stress granule localization that occurs as part of an integrated stress response in arsenite-treated hela cells . in response to environmental stress eukaryotic cells reprogram their mrna metabolism to adapt to stress-induced damage. mhv-induces a host translational shutoff that is reminiscent of a cellular stress response sgs appear numerous mrnas including protein translation-related factors are downregulated and levels of phosphorylated translation initiation factors increase . sars-cov infected cells do not allow production of interferon and so it seems likely that sars-cov like many other viruses has developed mechanisms to subvert the interferon response .in the course of sepsis both innate and acquired immune systems are involved in its development in which the mononuclear phagocyte system plays a crucial role. although monocytes/macrophages system plays a vital role in sepsis the acquired immune system is equally important and the effect of as on t and b cells function remains to be investigated in the future. using respective primers displayed in supplementary table 2 real-time pcr was performed 7900ht fast real-time pcr system or abi 7500 real-time pcr system applied biosystems darmstadt germany . sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection singer et al 2016 . based on our results we speculated that the excessive high level of vdr during the immunosuppression stage of sepsis might be related to the decreased inflammatory response. considering the extensive biological effects of vitamin d as well as its role in maintenance of homeostasis in organisms it is necessary to maintain the physiological concentration of vitamin d. based on our results we consider that low level of vitamin d might lead to the insufficiency of anti-inflammation response in human body but excessive vitamin d might induce the high level of vdr expression however the excessive overexpression of vdr might lead to a decreased immune function. interacting molecular prediction for as was performed against 5 311 proteins using the weighted ensemble similarity wes algorithm zheng et al 2015 assembled in the traditional chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform tcmsp . sepsis is a leading cause of death worldwide angus van der poll 2013 it arises when hosts response to pathogen infections such as bacterial fungal viral and parasitic infection and then injury their own tissues and organs hotchkiss monneret payen 2013b . it is made available under a the copyright holder for this preprint which was not peer-reviewed is the chemiluminescence-marked images were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate perkinelmer nrowalk ct usa with a chemidoc™ touch imaging system bio-rad hercules ca usa and analyzed using the image lab packages bio-rad . immune complexes were collected using the protein a/g beads and subjected to sds-page and western blotting as described above. based on that our results showed as could inhibit vdr expression to up-regulate the transcription of atg16l1 and increase autophagy activity we considered that the discrepancy for the transcriptional regulation between vdr and atg16l1 might be due to the differences in the inflammation and immune status. the resulting recombinant lentivirus was named vdr-kd nf-κb p65-kd and nc-kd.these different mechanisms might allow pathogens to escape and propagate as seems to be the case for h pylori and herpes simplex virus-2 3 1. the c5a receptor c5ar the complement system is part of the humoral innate immune system. the expression of the formyl peptide receptors in a variety of cells other than phagocytic cells suggests that they might have functional roles beyond that of host defense in innate immune response. thus the differential activation of two signalling pathways that are involved in the production of two cytokines with opposite actions as well as the concentration dependence and time-lag in their expression could explain how the same receptor can generate contrary immune responses. finally a recent study demonstrates that the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 27 pacap27 a multifunctional neuropeptide hormone that influences the immune system by both suppressing and activating inflammation through the regulation of several interleukins activates neutrophils via fprl1 stimulation . since b-arrestins sequester phosphorylated erk1/2 preventing nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation it seems highly beneficial for chemoattractant receptors to signal essentially through the g protein and not through b-arrestins to ensure the activation of transcription factors that regulate the synthesis of modulators of inflammatory and immune responses. this immune escape might be of importance for the pathogenesis of h pylori and hsv-2. indeed it has been shown in a soluble reconstituted system that fpr phosphorylation can block the interaction of the g protein independently of b-arrestin binding . the inappropriate activation of the complement system leads to inflammatory disorders and a number of pathologies. the reader is referred to a recent review that discusses the role of fprl1 in microglial cell responses in alzheimer disease . recycling thus appears to be b-arrestin-dependent therefore assigning an expanded role for b-arrestin in receptor trafficking b-arrestin binding most likely occurs in the endosomal system but how b-arrestins regulate the recycling of fpr is still unknown. in co-expression systems fpr and c5ar can also couple to g i1 g 0 and a ptx-resistant g protei . cell responses to chemotactic factors are tightly controlled by up-regulation through priming or down-regulation by desensitization/internalization for a review see ref.coronavirus plpro not only processes the viral polypeptide onto functional proteins but is also a deubiquitinating enzyme that can dampen host anti-viral response by hijacking the ubiquitin ub system. for all the plants analyzed nearly half of the top 30 pathways enriched in kegg are related to antiviral immune/inflammatory responses and hypoxia response indicating that these herbs are suitable for anti-viral usage. for the 26 herbs about 1/3 of the top 30 kegg-enriched pathways mean = 11 were related to regulating viral infection immune/inflammatory reactions and hypoxia response indicating that they are potentially effective treatments for viral respiratory infection fig 3 and online supplementary fig. the antiviral activities of the 115 natural compounds were reportedly confirmed with enzyme-based cell-free or cell-based experimental systems. the first is that the anti-coronavirus 2019-ncov components contained in the source plants should be absorbable via oral prescription. toward the end of december 2019 a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov with human-to-human transmission and severe human infection originating in wuhan china was identified . this is important as the anti-coronavirus effects of the selected compounds have been biologically confirmed and the genetic similarities between coronavirus 2019-ncov and sars or mers coronavirus are high . s1 indicating the natural compounds we selected might directly inhibit 2019-ncov. while specific vaccines and antiviral agents are the most effective methods to prevent and treat viral infection there are not yet effective treatments that target the 2019-ncov. the gene sequence of 2019-ncov has been released which suggests high similarities between the main proteins in this virus and those previously identified in sars-cov or mers-cov . it is a challenge to screen out the herbs containing anticoronavirus 2019-ncov compounds from the large number of those possibly being used for patients infected with this pathogen especially in very short time. this method was an expeditious way to identify natural components both preexisting in chinese herbal treatment and having a high possibility of anti-coronavirus 2019-ncov activity.specific gross lesions are seldom observed in the central nervous system or kidneys. no cell culture system is available for routine isola tion of virus g. control. no cell culture system is available for routine isolation of virus g. control. no evidence of circulating or tissue immune com plexes was found f. diagnosis. he concluded that the virus was probably endemic in some rabbit colonies in maryland found that 17% of 76 rabbits were immune to infection. the lymphoproliferative lesions in cotton tail rabbits occur in the lymphoid and other organ systems hinze 1971b . the iymphoproliferative lesions in cottontail rabbits occur in the lymphoid and other organ systems hinze 1971b hesselton et ai 1988 . experimental inoculation of rabbits with human adenovirus type 5 resulted in no clinical response but induced a persistent viral infection in lymphoid tissues for as long as 1 year . experimental inocu lation of rabbits with human adenovirus type 5 resulted in no clinical response but induced a persistent viral infection in lymphoid tissues for as long as 1 year . immune sera to 229e but not aibv and porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus inhibited the hemagglutination activity of the rabbit coronavirus. no evidence of circulating or tissue immune complexes was found fennestad et ai 1981 fennestad et ai 1986 f. diagnosis. electron microscopy of fecal samples using antisera to rabbit coronavirus revealed immune aggregates of viral particles with morphological features of co ronaviruses .in terms of the human immune system the innate immune system response plays an important role in controlling the replication and infection of coronavirus and interferon is expected to enhance the immune response 11 . since 2019-ncov is highly homologous with sars-cov it is considered a close relative of sars-cov. potential anti-coronavirus therapies can be divided into two categories depending on the target one is acting on the human immune system or human cells and the other is on coronavirus itself. because wuhan viral pneumonia cases were discovered at the end of 2019 the coronavirus was named as 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-ncov by the world health organization who on january 12 2020 7 8 . the international virus classification commission ictv classified 2019-ncov as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars-cov-2 on february 11 2020. at the same time who named the disease caused by 2019-ncov as covid-19. there are three coronavirus virulence factors nsp1 nsp3c and orf7a related to interfering host s innate immunity and assisting coronavirus immune escape. in order to acquire more three-dimensional structure information of proteins about these new coronaviruses for subsequent drug screening we aligned all protein sequences from sars-cov-2 with all sequences in pdb1018 database in fold function assignment system supporting information figs. both sars-cov and mers-cov are zoonotic viruses and their hosts are bat/civet and dromedary respectively 5 6 . the above results suggest that these small-molecule compounds might be the potential 3clpro inhibitors and could probably be used for treating sars-cov-2. and the detailed results of virtual screening are given in supplementary excel files. the detailed results of virtual screening are shown in supporting excel files. we analyzed 21 targets based on the docking results and found that nsp3b nsp3c nsp7_nsp8 complex nsp14 nsp15 plpro 3clpro rdrp helicase e-channel spike and ace2 are more likely to be therapeutic targets of anti-viral drugs.although ang ii was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system. however the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. on the other hand ras has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. the ace2 peptidase is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system ras . the twirls system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. however twirls did not directly associate ifitms with any category so we needed to provide more information so that twirls can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response. the genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories. figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of ras system after ace2 combines with the coronavirus. for example for category c3 the hr label is neurotrophic coronavirus related to immune-mediated demyelination . for example cshgs associated with category c3 or associated with c5 or c10 were closer to each other in th networks figure 2 suggesting that twirls can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference. pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the ras component which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local ang ii . the sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus sars-cov-2 at the end of december 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide.ace2 is also related to adaptive immune responses 8 . we speculated that the immune system dysfunction involved in the high expression of . in this current study the gsea analysis showed that the high expression of ace2 was related to innate immune response acquired immune response b cell regulatory immunity and cytokine secretion and enhanced the inflammatory response induced by il-1 il-10 il-6 il-8 cytokines. we performed gsea gene set enrichment analysis and found that the expression of ace2 was mainly associated with innate and acquired immune responses regulation of b cell mediated immunity cytokine and il-1，il-10，il-6，il-8 secretion . it indicated that 2019-ncov . considering higher expression of ace2 was involved in mediating inflammatory responses immune activities and viral replication in both healthy individuals and infected cells we further explored protein-protein regulation network in viral activity-related proteins and cytokine secretion respectively. later a novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was identified based on sequencing of the patient respiratory tract samples. in conclusion 2019-ncov infection is a serious public health problem endangers human health seriously. considering the sequence of 2019-ncov is similar to the sras-cov and they are reported to share the same molecular as the entry point analyses of ace2 expression and distribution in lung and related biological processes may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-ncov. these results may help us understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-ncov. it was assumed that the long-term smoking could elevate the expression of ace2 and thus increase the susceptibility to 2019-ncov infection. among the 2019-ncov infected patients there are many patients with underlying diseases such as chronic respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease.fprs are involved in a variety of signaling systems and their distribution and functions are not limited to the immune system. the interaction of resolvin d1 with these gpcrs was examined by a gpcr-β-arrestin-coupled system . the competitive analysis showed that they are specific for fpr1 and did not inhibit fpr2- fpr3- cxcr1-or murine mfpr1-dependent responses. a quinazolinone derivative was previously reported to suppress fpr agonist-stimulated inflammatory responses in vitro and in an in vivo model . the pepducin f1pal16 derived from a segment of the third intracellular loop of fpr1 was found to inhibit fpr2-mediated cellular response but had no effect on fpr1 signaling . sarpopeptate and its dipeptide derivatives were shown to have potent inhibitory effects on fmlf-stimulated neutrophil responses and exhibit a receptor preference for fpr1 over fpr2 . as fprs are potentially attractive drug target molecules that inhibit cell responses induced by fpr agonists are thought to have therapeutic value for fpr-related diseases. it inhibits f2l-induced response in mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells which express fpr3 but not other fprs. for example the pepducins p2y2palic2 and p2y2palic3 that contain sequences of the second and third intracellular loops of p2y2r were identified to be fpr2 agonists and could activate neutrophils with responses inhibited by fpr2 antagonists but not p2y2r antagonist . it was suggested that pam- lys-βnspe 6-nh 2 and its structural analogs are allosteric modulators of fpr2 because they can inhibit neutrophil responses induced by the fpr2 pepducin f2pal10 which is assumed to act in a different way from conventional fpr2 agonists by anchoring to the intracellular loop of the receptor . in summary future studies of binding properties and off-target effects are needed to determine the bona fide antagonists among compounds that have been identified to suppress fpr agonist-stimulated cell responses in functional activity assays. in another study a lignin pp-6 2r 3r -2- 3 4 -dihydroxybenzyl -3- 3 4 -dimethoxybenzyl butyrolactone isolated from piper philippinum was found to inhibit fmlf-induced neutrophil response and block fitc-fmlf binding to neutrophil wit of 1 5 µm.in order to understand the mechanism s by which host nutritional status promotes viral mutation we examined the host cellular responses viral responses and the host innate immune response. the innate immune response characterized by the early production of anti-viral cytokines including interferon ifn -a/b ifn-g and il-12 plays an important role in controlling the replication of many viruses and in directing the magnitude of the subsequent adaptive immune response. in a cellular system we found that exposure of cultured 293hek cells to 0 3 mm tbhp for 24 hrs was completely cytotoxic. chlorogenic acid also increases the enzymatic activity of glutathione s-transferases gst as well as that of antioxidant response element are -mediated induction of a luciferase reporter. we found that av-c dose-dependently inhibited serum-induced hasmc proliferation as measured by 3 h thymidine incorporation and by counting cell numbers. these data indicate that upregulation of nox1 does indeed affect both the pressor and hypertrophic responses to ang ii in a rosdependent manner supporting the concept that nox1 may be involved in the development of cardiovascular pathologies. in this study we found that das can induce the expression of heme oxygenase-1 ho-1 which plays a critical role in cell defense system against oxidative stress. these data demonstrate that se deficiency impairs the early antiviral cytokine response and at least one aspect of the proinflammatory and chemokine responses. earlier we have shown that avenanthramides polyphenols found exclusively in oat grain inhibited proinflammatory cytokines and adhesive interaction of immune and endothelial cells. subjects were fed by the metabolic kitchen from weeks 1-12 and were taught a calorie counting system to allow them to prepare their own meals for the next 10 weeks weeks 12-22 . collectively the data demonstrate that the antioxidant status of drosophila can be modulated by dietary provision or restriction and that this alters oxidative stress responses. herein we report a quantitative assessment of the water-and lipid-soluble antioxidant profile of canton s wild-type and ry531 urate-deficient drosophila strains and demonstrate that dietary provision or restriction of these antioxidants is a powerful means by which to modulate antioxidant status and oxidative stress responses in the fly.in this study we applied a modified sir model to evaluate the burden of healthcare system during the 2019-ncov outbreak in wuhan china. in anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human transmissible epidemic we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare system during the 2019-ncov outbreak in china. our analysis is limited by the availability of data and the lack of understanding of 2019-ncov. in this study we synthesised available information during the 2019-ncov outbreak occurring in wuhan city china and estimated the burden on healthcare system effected by the increasing numbers of cases using a modified sir model. otherwise the current healthcare system would not be able to sustain. should be implemented as to avoidance of healthcare system breakdown. to combat the 2019-ncov outbreak authorities in china have implemented several preventive measures. the symptom onset date of the first 2019-ncov patient was identified in early december 2019 and the outbreak started in late december with most of cases epidemiologically connected to a seafood market in the city of wuhan hubei province china . a novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in wuhan central china and now named as 2019-ncov has surged in the public. imported healthcare support from other cities are certainly vital to the healthcare system in wuhan during the present outbreak. similarly greater benefits for healthcare system are expected to obtain if higher efficacy can be achieved e g 80% or 90% . whilst awaiting the effectiveness of a series of measures to be seen such evolving outbreak is expected to impose substantial burdens on healthcare system.warning systems response networks and real time tracking are important tools for containing outbreaks but they do not actually prevent them from occurring in the first place. human factors include whether the population is immunologically naïve or not how well the human immune system can respond to the virus age structure of a population population density as well as mobility and cultural behaviors. the stakes are high: who estimates that a moderate to severe pandemic would cost about $500 billion or 0 6% of global income 33 as has been shown repeatedly an epidemic doesn t need to reach severe levels or have many or technically speaking even any casualties in order to destabilize national health systems or put a strain on the networks responsible for international and global response and the economy. therefore having a strong and adapted ipc response to this outbreak will be crucial to stopping it. the scale of china s response to the pandemic is unprecedented. the member views concerning this decision were quite divided during the first meeting but the who agreed to reassess this decision in a few days time 39 and changed its global risk assessment for sars-cov-2 from moderate to high 83 it maintains that there is no evidence that donors withheld disaster relief funds if a pheic was not declared 84 it is worth noting that the who repeatedly declined labeling the 2018 ebola outbreak as such as well showing that there is a tendency to err to the side of caution 85 when it did in 2019 there was prevailing opinion that the pheic designation would be game changing in terms of resources allocated and international response 86 we predict that the pheic designation for coronavirus will help mobilize response on a global scale. there are health system and human factors as well that will impact the spread of a virus. health systems are varied a small outbreak of the flu in a high resource country with a robust health system will likely only have a small impact on the continual habitual or average delivery of health services that have nothing to do with the outbreak. level of education and previous knowledge of general infection prevention measures also play a role 34 systemic factors that will determine the severity of an outbreak or pandemic include the resilience of health systems co-existing external factors that would hinder an appropriate response and the ability of a governing body to respond to the outbreak implement infection control measures in the population and continue to function despite a health emergency. traditionally supranational organizations international institutions and non-governmental organizations will fill that response vacuum as well as is possible. a health system that is fragile or already overloaded by either routine care or another emergency needs only a little disruption to damage it or even causes it to collapse. it seems to be quite virulent.much is unknown about how 2019-ncov spreads. the modelling techniques that we used in this study are based on seir and system dynamics. the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov is fast spreading now to over 20 countries. until now we still know little about the infectiousness of 2019-ncov. and our model is parameterized with the latest official released data of 2019-ncov. in december 2019 atypical pneumonia caused by the zoonotic 2019 novel coronavirus 2019-ncov was first reported and confirmed in wuhan china. using the latest cumulated confirmed number 31161 feb 6 th 2020 t=83 we estimate the parameter b=0 038678. hence the basic reproduction numbe = k b t e =2 7. and the transmission rate without prevention measures is β =k b= 0 1934. most chinese people were aware of the outbreak of 2019-ncov by the mainstream media after 20 january 2020. the hubei government released the announcement about strengthening the prevention and control measures against 2019-ncov and launched the second-level public health emergency response at 2:40am on 22 january 2020. thus the public awareness and effective interventions were absent when the . so maybe traditional transmission models of epidemic spreading are not suit for 2019-ncov. if 2019-ncov similar to influenza has strong seasonality in its transmission our epidemic forecast might not be reliable. that is when t 69 k=0. given that 2019-ncov could be controlled under the strong prevention measures of what china has taken and it will take about three months. if the quarantined rate is less than 63% the epidemic spreading of 2019-ncov will never be eliminated and the infected population would still keep increasing.the innate immune system initiates defensive responses to infecting viruses and bacteria by recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns pamps as non-self signatures. whereas the specific and stable interaction of ifit1 with cap0-mrna may account for its ability to inhibit translation and thus impair replication of specific viruses the observation that ifit1b which lacks an isre-containing promoter and is not transcriptionally induced by ifn or dsrna also binds cap0-mrnas suggests that it might regulate translation of specific cellular mrnas in circumstances that are unrelated to the innate immune response. moreover the absence of ifit1 in ifit à/à mice and murine embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages enhanced replication o -o-methylation-defective mutant forms of human coronavirus 229 e and mouse hepatitis virus family coronaviridae poxvirus family poxviridae west nile virus and japanese encephalitis virus family flaviviridae which are normally very sensitive to innate immune responses 22 35 . the oligomerization status of different ifit proteins was analyzed using the nativepage gel system invitrogen as per the manufacturer s instructions. expression of ifit1 is strongly up-regulated in response to viral infection by ifn-dependent and -independent mechanisms 8 65 and ifit1-mediated translational regulation likely primarily targets viral mrnas. capping of mrna mrna 30 mg was included in a capping reaction performed using the t7 mscript standard mrna production system cellscript madison wi usa . binding of ifit1 and ifit1b to cap0-mrnas abrogates 48s complex formation in the in vitro reconstituted translation system. fractions that corresponded to ribosomal complexes were trichloroacetic acid precipitated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sds-page using the nupage 4-12% bis-tris gel system invitrogen with subsequent fluorescent sypro invitrogen staining. the promoters of most ifit genes contain one to four ifn-stimulated response elements isre typically located within 200 bp upstream of the transcription start site that are recognized by ifn regulatory factors leading to rapid induction of transcription. we therefore decided to investigate the ribosomal binding activity of hifit1 and its influence on 43s complex formation using an in vitro reconstituted translation system. the effect of hifit1 hifit2 hifit3 hifit5 rifit1 and rifit1b on 48s initiation complex formation on cap0- cap1-an ppp-mrnas the influence of ifits on translation initiation was investigated using an in vitro reconstituted translation system 48s complexes were assembled from individual purified 40s subunits met-trna i met eif2 eif3 eif1 eif1a eif4a eif4b and eif4f on cap0- cap1-an ppp-b-globin g mrnas in the presence and absence of ifits and analyzed by toe-printing. sequence similarity between the different ifit proteins within a species is high 44-98% identity 11 but they are differentially expressed depending on the cell and tissue type respond differently to ifn and different viruses and have different effects on replication of individual viruses suggesting that different ifits have non-redundant functions in the host response to viral infection e g. .cats that exhibit a partial cell-mediated immune response may develop noneffusive fip disease u an effective cell-mediated immune response does not always eliminate fip coronavirus from the body. the ts-fipv proteins stimulate local immunoglobulin a and a cell-mediated immune response as well as a systemic cell-mediated immune response that may deter systemic dissemination of the fip corona virus 12 • 16 • 17 the manufacturer smithkiine beecham animal health recommends administering the primucell-fip vaccine intranasally to healthy cats 16 weeks of age or older. some cats however may develop a transient fever that lasts for 1 to 5 days and mild mesenteric iymphadenopathy 30 if the infected cat is unable to mount an effective cellmediated immune response and produces coronavirus antibodies that do not neutralize the virus infection progresses rapidly into a fulminating form of fip disease. a similar situation may occur if the cat has already acquired coronavirus antibodies through previous infection with a strain of feline enteric coronavirus or fip coronavirus of low virulence 6 in the absence of an effective cell-mediated immune response a strong nonprotective humoral response may result in effusive form of fip disease. lesions of central nervous system are usually multifocal or diffuse pyogranulomas and are located around the smaller blood vessels. the febrile response on days 1 and 3 postchallenge were significantly lower in the vaccinated kittens p 0 05 . in some recovered cats the infection may persist in various places in the body such as the gastrointestinal tract or associated lymph nodes 30 factors that depress cell-mediated immune responsiveness such as feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus infections concurrent disease and advanced age may allow recrudescence of macrophageassociated infection with periodic shedding of fip corona virus thereby resulting in effusive or noneffusive disease 2 • 4 an exaggerated and nonprotective humoral response results in excessive levels of coronavirus antibodies and the formation of large immune complexes that are rapidly phagocytized by reticuloendothelial cells 44 immune complexes deposited in small blood vessels fix and activate complement thereby resulting in the release of the third component of complement. effective drug therapy for fip disease relies on the use of systemic corticosteroids such as oral prednisolone 2 to 4 mg/kg daily to decrease the disseminated corona virus antibody-mediated vasculitis 9 although corticosteroids may provide short-term remission long-term use is not curative in cats with disease resulting from defective cell-mediated immune response. phagocytosis of aggregates containing coronavirus immunoglobulin and complement is aided by the presence of receptors for immunoglobulin and complement on the macrophage surface 43 macrophages that are in perivascular locations ingest aggregates of intact fip coronavirus immunoglobulin and complement and thus encourage replication of the virus and the release of new virus and complement components 20 uptake and processing of fip coronavirus in these macrophages may be enhanced by an impaired cell-mediated immune response 5 recurrent complement-mediated damage results in the release of chemotactic complement components and the attraction of neutrophils. abdominal palpation usually elicits no response of pain. in addition to correlating the positive coronavirus-antibody titer with other diagnostic information on the patient the clinician should be aware that differences in assay results can be found between diagnostic laboratories and in the clinician s own interpretation of assay results 2 a few cats with histopathologically confirmed pip disease may have negative coronavirus-antibody titers 5 reasons for negative titers include disappearance of coronavirus antibodies in the terminal stages of pip disease formation of immune complexes that leave little if any free coronavirus antibodies to react in the assay procedure use of assay systems that are not sensitive enough to detect low levels of coronavirus antibodies and presence of small amounts of coronavirus antibodies in fulminating cases of effusive diseasey in addition bovine serum components found in some commercial feline vaccines may induce antibody production in cats vaccinated with those prod-ucts. if the cat shows a favorable response to therapy during the first few weeks treatment should be continued for at least 3 months 9 if the cat is in complete remission at the end of 3 months the corticosteroids may be slowly withdrawn.an impaired ifn signaling may also affect innate immune response to non-viral pathogens. the innate immune response of the urogenital epithelium provides the first line of defense against pathogens and may protect against urogenital cancers. accordingly studies have reported an association between prostate cancer risk and mutations or genetic variants in innate immune response genes 2 3 . one of the host factors of importance for innate immune response to sti could be a germline dinucleotide polymorphism rs368234815 tt or δg alleles in the ifnl4 gene that encodes ifn-λ4 a type-iii interferon 16 17 . as a key finding our study revealed a gene-environment interaction in prostate cancer etiology between increased exposure to sti due to sexual activity and a germline genetic variant ifnl4-δg that regulates the innate immune response to infections in epithelial cells. gleason grading system was used to classify prostate tumors into low-grade gleason score ≤ 7 or high-grade gleason score 7 . in general case-control study designs are influenced by inherent biases including recall response and interviewer biases. a role of the interferon-inducible system in the pathogenesis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer is further suggested by germline mutations in rnasel a gene involved in the interferon antiviral pathway that were found to predispose men to familial prostate cancer 2 47 . whether the observed association is due to carcinogenic effects of a putative etiologic infectious agent or rather due to the host s response to the infectious agent needs to be examined in future work. because the exact viral pathogens causing sti in the prostate gland are unknown we infected human prostate cancer cell lines with sendai virus sev which is a murine rna virus that infects diverse human cell types and induces a robust antiviral response including ifn-λ4 expression in primary human hepatocytes 17 . nevertheless the fact that we observed a dose response relationship that fits a biologically plausible mechanism suggests that the associations we observed warrant further investigations including prospective cohorts. as aa are more likely than ea men to carry the δg allele the effect was more pronounced in the former population.the immune response of t cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to b cell where the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response . the main concept within all the immunizations is the ability of the vaccine to initiate an immune response in a faster mode than the pathogen itself. the core mechanism of the peptide vaccines is built on the chemical method to synthesize the recognized b-cell and t-cell epitopes that are immunodominant and can induce specific immune responses. peptide-based vaccines do not need in vitro culture making them biologically safe and their selectivity allows accurate activation of immune responses . these mutations lied on the surface of the protein which make covid-19 more superior than other previous strains by inducing its sustainability leaving the immune system in blind spot . doi doi: biorxiv preprint iedb website was used to analyze 2019-ncov envelope protein for t cell related peptides. vaccines that effectively generate cell-mediated response are needed to provide protection against the invading pathogen. however covid-19 differs from other previous strains in having several critical residues at 2019-ncov receptor-binding motif particularly gln493 which provide advantageous interactions with human ace2 . moreover the cd8+ t and cd4+ t cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity . although traditional vaccines which depend on biochemical trials induced potent neutralizing and protective responses in the immunized animals but they can be costly allergenic time consuming and require in vitro culture of pathogenic viruses leading to serious concern of safety . finally results were . structural cov-2019 protein n s e and m was analyzed by vaxijen with threshold of 0 4 link it is a software package proposed to stream a distinct program that can run nearly any sequence operation as well as a few basic alignment investigations.intriguingly just the n-terminal portion of p3a is able to evoke a strong humoral immune response zhong et al 2006 . being efficiently expressed on the cell surface the protein was easily detected in a majority of sars patients due to the triggering of a humoral and cellular immune response in these patients . the discrepancies regarding the functions of p7b during sars-cov replication may be due to the different systems and animal models used. proteins 8b and 8ab have been shown to undergo ubiquitination when expressed in both in vitro expression systems and in cell culture le et al 2007 . proteins 7a and 7b of fipv are involved in counteracting the antiviral response exerted by type-i interferons with support from proteins 3a and 3b. this could be involved in evading host immunity systems or even facilitate the assembly of sars-cov p3a can be detected in the supernatant in two different forms from infected vero e6 cells or caco2 cells lu et al 2006 . taken together these results point to a role of the c-terminal domain of p6 in modulating host protein nuclear transport and type-i interferon signaling which may be important for immune evasion during sars-cov infection. moreover p8b and p8ab physically interact with monoubiquitin as well as polyubiquitin suggesting potential involvement of these proteins in the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. furthermore involvement of p3b has also been demonstrated in the induction of necrosis and apoptosis independent of its subcellular localization khan et al 2006 p3b is also able to inhibit the antiviral response the eight accessory proteins 3a 3b 6 7a 7b 8a 8b and 9b are shown as colored boxes. in another study it has been shown that p4a p4b and p5 are all potent interferon antagonists with p4a being the most powerful in counteracting the antiviral effects of ifn via the inhibition of both interferon production and isre interferon-stimulated response element promoter element signaling pathways . extensive functional studies in cell culture and animal models have shown that sars-cov accessory proteins are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as cell proliferation programmed cell death activation of stress response pathways and cytokine production to name just a few. using sucrose gradient fractionation and immune-gold labeling schaecher et al demonstrated that p7b is associated with intracellular viruses and incorporated into purified virions although more stringent viruscapture assays have not been performed see table 5 .since asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations of mers-cov infection are often associated with low levels of seropositivity the analysis of mers-cov-specific cellular immune responses may facilitate further insight into the immune correlates of disease prevention. here we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an mva-delivered mers-cov n antigen for the activation of cellular immune responses in mice. thus the induction of n-specific immune responses in these animals emphasizes the potential usefulness of the mers-cov n protein to serve as vaccine antigen. moreover the mers-cov n antigen produced in mva-mers-n infected cells was strongly recognized by antibodies from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that n-specific immune responses were potently activated upon mers-cov infection. overlapping peptides were pooled using a two-dimensional pooled-peptide matrix system table s1 and screened by ifn-γ elispot. the availability of such an epitope may allow for more detailed experimental monitoring of cellular immune responses induced by a mva based candidate vaccine against mers-cov in the mouse model and potentially also in other preclinical models. future work with mva-mers-n candidate vaccines should help to elucidate the potential protective capacity of n-specific immune responses in mers-cov infections models and contribute to our better understanding of mers vaccine-induced protection. this observation is in line with the fact that the mva-mers-s candidate vector vaccine expresses the mers-cov s gene sequences using the identical pmh5 promoter system . t cell responses against coronaviruses are known to be long lived and mostly target the more conserved cov internal structural n protein. this observation is attributed to the emergence of specific virus mutants evading the neutralizing antibody response as already described for sars-cov . the recognition of the mers-cov n protein was at least as prominent as the mers-cov s antigen which was suggestive of the induction of substantial n-specific antibody responses after experimental mers-cov infections. in line with this data recent studies in mers patients demonstrated that both antibody and t cell responses are associated with recovery from mers-cov infection .it is not clear how the existence or titer of preinfection antibody affects the magnitude of the response detected by these tests. antibody response of individuals infected with this virus appeared to be specific enough to avoid confusion with 229e 42 . except for 229e none of the human coronaviruses had been successfully propagated in a system other than organ culture. species-specificity is observed here too but even in cell systems of human origin isolation of some types has not been possible. however this cell line is not a reliable system for primary isolation of 229e-like agents. the most involved procedure must be used for those viruses which up to now have never been adapted to systems other than organ culture 39 . serologic response to either induced or to naturally acquired infection has been quite variable depending on the infecting strain and the serologic test employed. to date human embryonic intestine ma177 has proven the most suitable cell system but it is available only in limited quantities 29 . finally immune electron microscopy has been added to the methods available for identifying the presence of coronaviruses in organ culture harvests. if a practical system can be found for isolation and propagation of the viruses the gaps in understanding the behavior of these agents would quickly be filled. while the animal strains are readily isolated in several different systems recovery of the human strains has posed major problems. however cross reactions were commonly demonstrable even by this method using animal antiserum or immune ascitic fluid indicating that there must be many shared antigens.our work should be broadly useful for researchers who study the interaction between this virus and the host immune system. we made the analyses publicly available as a resource to the research community in the form of the 2019-ncov immune viewer:link to predict the mhc class i and class ii binding peptides of all 2019-ncov proteins which could elicit cd8 + and cd4 + t cell responses for viral clearance fig 1a . we correlated this immune vulnerability map of the 2019-ncov proteins with their possible mutational hotspots. in this report we characterized the immune vulnerability landscape of the 2019-ncov and compared it with that of sars and mers. for comparison we also computed the immune vulnerability maps of sars fig 1e and mers fig 1f which are the two most aggressive coronaviruses together with 2019-ncov. overall we believe that the 2019-ncov immune viewer will be a valuable resource for the research community and will facilitate immunological research into this virus. inspired by this observation we reasoned that the evolution of the immune vulnerability maps of sars and mers due to genetic variation may reveal insight into 2019-ncov. we created the 2019-ncov immune viewer fig 3 to openly share the virus immunogenicity data we created for 2019-ncov and also sars and mers. the same may happen to the 2019-ncov virus as well but this remains to be proved. the 2019-ncov immune viewer is available at:link of a ncov b sars and c mers for the major hla-a alleles shown as examples allele frequency larger than 1% in the european american ea and hongkong chinese hk populations. the database is under continuous development and will be updated timely when new strains of 2019-ncov are made available. the above analyses are conducted for the 2019-ncov reference genome.after 2019-ncov impairs the immune system it is difficult to prevent the is the author/funder who has granted medrxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. decreased lymphocytes suggested that 2019-ncov may 168 primarily attack the body s immune system especially the t lymphocytes which is similar to the 169 action of sars-cov . these results suggested that the level of d-dimer was 158 significantly positively correlated with the 2019-ncov severe pneumonia which was also shown in 159 another study . ace2 is a receptor 162 protein of both sars-cov and 2019-ncov and it is abundantly present in the epithelia of the lung 163 and small intestine . patients the patient data were extracted from the central hospital of wuhan which is a tertiary teaching 69 hospital and is responsible for the treatment for patients with 2019-ncov pneumonia as assigned by 70 the chinese government. the aim of this 39 study was to assess the potential high-risk factors of 2019-ncov severe pneumonia and provide 40 evidence for the screening of severely afflicted patients. it was reported that 2019-ncov binds to the ace2 in the same way as sars- 164 cov inducing damage to the pulmonary arteries and leading to the extensive embolization in the 165 extensive alveolar terminal capillaries. a previous study reported that hypoalbuminemia is 151 a potent dose-dependent predictor of poor outcomes for pneumonia with the coronavirus infection 152 an elevated amount of c-reactive protein may be associated with the inflammatory response and 153 cytokine storms caused by the virus in the blood vessels. based on 55 the patients exposure history clinical symptoms laboratory examinations and chest ct scans all of 56 the patients were clinically diagnosed with 2019-ncov pneumonia according to who s interim 57 guidance . the world 27 health organization who named it the 2019-novel coronavirus 2019-ncov and announced that 28 the new coronavirus epidemic had been listed as a public health emergency of international concern on 29 january 30 2020. as of 18:00 on february 11 2020 there were 42 744 confirmed cases 21 675 30 suspected cases 4 161 cured cases and 1 017 deaths in china 31 the 2019-ncov which belongs to the genus betacoronavirus is a single-stranded positive-strand 32 rna virus that appears to be distinct from but is related to other coronaviruses such as severe acute 33 respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus sarsr-cov and middle east respiratory syndrome 34 coronavirus mersr-cov . a 93 two-sided α of less than 0 05 was considered statistically significant. current studies have shown that 2019-ncov has about an 89% 35 homology with bat sars-like-covzxc21 and 82% homology with human sars-cov .the individual s immune system factors include genetics such as hla genes age gender nutritional status neuroendocrine-immune regulation and physical status. to better survive in host cells sars-cov and mers-cov use multiple strategies to avoid immune responses. in conclusion the occurrence and development of sars-cov-2 depend on the interaction between the virus and the individual s immune system. chymotrypsin-like 3c-like protease 3clpro and papain-like protease plp are non-structural proteins which have an essential function for coronaviral replication and can inhibit the host innate immune responses . comparing to humoral responses there are more researches on the cellular immunity of coronavirus. the cytokine storm will trigger a violent attack by the immune system to the body cause ards and multiple organ failure and finally lead to death in severe cases of sars-cov-2 infection just like what occurs in sars-cov and mers-cov infection . one of the main mechanisms for ards is the cytokine storm the deadly uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from the release of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-α ifn-γ il-1β il-6 il-12 il-18 il-33 tnf-α tgfβ etc and chemokines ccl2 ccl3 ccl5 cxcl8 cxcl9 cxcl10 etc by immune effector cells in sars-cov infection 15 . novel coronavirus induced pneumonia which was named as coronavirus disease 2019 by the who on the 11th of february 2020 has rapidly increased in epidemic scale since it first appeared in wuhan china in december 2019 . similarly the acute phase response in patients with sars-cov is associated with severe decrease of cd4 + t and cd8 + t cells. therefore destroying the immune evasion of sars-cov-2 is imperative in its treatment and specific drug development. six years after sars-cov infection specific t-cell memory responses to the sars-cov s peptide library could still be identified in 14 of 23 recovered sars patients . even if there is no antigen cd4 + and cd8 + memory t cells can persist for four years in a part of sars-cov recovered individuals and can perform t cell proliferation dth response and production of ifn-γ .\n"

      "regarding evlw there was no signifi cant correlation between two systems.cysteine c should be avoided perhaps replaced by serine s not least because of the formation of unwanted cys-cys s-s disulfide bonds although at either end of the peptide a cys c already present or added can provide the link to a carrier protein that is essential for b immune system antibody response and t system memory.\n",
      "concerns are for raising antibodies b immune system implanting immune system memory in the case of vaccines and specificity and avoiding unwanted cross reactions with other proteins with similar epitopes to the target protein of interest.\n",
      "some authors use the term more specifically for analogues that are not dependent on an immune response but act as an antagonist to in this case binding or cleavage.\n",
      "these projects resulted in a body of experience and design rules-ofthumb which the author and collaborators are seeking to capture by the methods described in section 4. it is to be understood that peptides proposed as b-epitopes for the construction of synthetic peptides rarely work well alone recall that immunogenicity is the ability of a particular substance to provoke an immune response in the body and that an epitope or antigenic determinant is the small part of an antigen that is recognized and distinguished by the immune system specifically by antibodies b cells or t cells .\n",
      "it is parts of the surface of a virus that normally interacts with the host cells for entry and which are vulnerable to the host immune system.\n",
      "although the dehydrogenase is a very different model system to any directly relating to 2019-ncov there were some interesting observations regarding emodin binding that might be extensible to more relevant simulations in a manner consistent with the above target refutation principle .\n",
      "also while b epitopes from exposed regions of a pathogen are key to the antibody response t epitopes from anywhere in the pathogen proteins may be needed for t-system memory and cellular responses and the overall structure may benefit from linkage to molecular adjuvants such as muramyl dipeptide and possibly to other stimulating and anti-suppressor peptides.\n",
      "as the situation appears at this time major simulation studies in this project will be delayed until an experimental structure of the 2019-ncov spike protein is forthcoming which at current rate of research on 2019-ncov will doubtless be soon.\n",

      "in the letter case it might require an additional peptide as a t-epitope for immune system memory which might come from anywhere in the s protein or even elsewhere in virus and perhaps other agents such as molecular adjuvant.although heat stress may boost the immune system above its normal level the result would not be noticeably protective if virions are dormant and therefore invisible to the immune system.\n",
      "an interesting and ingenious recent review looked directly at the seasonality of immune responses in humans by investigating antibody responses following vaccination .\n",
      "the authors commented that this may indicate that viral rna remained in the respiratory tract without being internalized and eliciting an immune response .\n",
      "influenza viruses have been detected several times in the absence of symptoms or an immune response in the host which seems to indicate that dormant influenza virus is present.\n",
      "however the good blood flow to the respiratory tract that is associated with heat stress allows the activated virions to be destroyed by the immune system.\n",
      "it is often assumed that an evolutionary arms race exists between viruses and the host immune system with each making a series of small improvements to gain an advantage over the other .\n",
      "the other four major epidemics listed above were in midwinter when according to this view the immune system should be at its weakest suggesting that the virus should spread and the epidemic should continue for more than eight weeks.\n",
      "for example the immune systems of hosts may frequently be activated by certain dominant viruses during the winter months reducing the likelihood of subsequent infection by less active strains.\n",
      "if we are going to say that the increase in varis in the cold season is due to the increased susceptibility of hosts in cold weather m3 it is difficult to explain why the human immune system appears to be less efficient in early autumn than in say february.\n",
      "however the authors do not tells us what proportion of volunteers were chilled by breathing cold air and what proportion by wearing scant clothing breathing cold air while remaining warm can be protective presumably because viruses are activated but they can be removed by the immune system.\n",
      "although the authors found seasonal variation in immunity it could not explain vari seasonality: seven of the studies of vaccines reviewed reported a stronger immune response in winter than in summer with only 1 showing the opposite trend.\n",
      "can we believe that the islanders immune systems could cope well with a regular 6°c drop but succumbed after a 7 5°c drop note that the absolute temperature after the dipabout 23°c at night -was still very comfortable and would certainly not cause a vari epidemic in say helsinki.they help to initiate the innate immune response and mediate signalling between the innate and the adaptive immune system.\n",
      "the respiratory innate immune system comprises both cellular and non-cellular components which limit the spread of any invading pathogens within the lung and activate the adaptive immune response to mount a specific response.\n",
      "individual respiratory viruses will activate various components of the innate immune system in a variety of ways and many have evolved mechanisms to hide or utilize the host response to prolong survival.\n",
      "both cellular and non-cellular components of the innate immune system are activated in bronchiolitis and psrw.\n",
      "many cytokines with both pro-and anti-inflammatory roles are produced by all cells of the innate immune system.\n",

      "the pathogenesis of both bronchiolitis and psrw is not fully understood but it is clear that the innate immune response plays an important role in limiting viral infections.\n",
      "they also have an immune suppressor effect in both the innate and adaptive immune responses to dampen down excess inflammation.\n",
      "defects in some components of the innate immune system have been shown to be associated with the development of more severe disease or the host s inability to clear the respiratory virus.\n",
      "why some infants are severely affected requiring admission to hospital whilst others experience a simple cold is not fully understood: research has suggested that the innate immune response to these viruses is important.\n",
      "monocytes express the integrin b3 receptor which is important for monocyte migration adhesion and signalling an early step in the innate immune response to respiratory viruses.\n",
      "it also activates neutrophils and nk cells 3. deficiencies in tlrs spa and d and il-8 role in the innate immune system have been shown to be associated with severe rsv disease 4. rhinovirus is a common cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract illness especially psrw: 30% of all infants under 3 years experience at least one episode of wheezing 5. rhinovirus has been shown to infect both airway epithelial cells and macrophages leading to their activation and differences in innate immune response have been shown between infants who develop asthma and those who are nonatopic 6. deficiencies in cytokine production at birth are associated with subsequent risk of wheezing 7. in the long term there is an increased risk of recurrent wheezing post rsv bronchiolitis.the introduction: neutrophil extracellular traps nets are one of the immune systems to suppress dissemination of infection by the netted chromatin decorated with antibacterial molecules.\n",
      "pamps cause either direct damage or trigger an immune response in the host to fight infection leading to the production of high levels of cytokines and the release of damps into the bloodstream which can trigger a maladaptive systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs that can contribute to organ injury.\n",

      "all pts were monitored with cpcco pulsion medical systems and serial tee have been performed.the type of immune response to hrsv is a major factor in the development of wheezing and asthma exacerbations.\n",
      "immune response to naturally acquired hrsv is poor and developing an effective vaccine faces the challenge of improving over the natural infection to elicit a balanced immune response including th1/th2 cd4 t cells cd8 t cells and hopefully hrsv-neutralizing antibodies including secretory iga.\n",
      "cell-mediated immune response is central to recovery from infection and immunosuppressed patients are at risk of severe hrsv disease and fatal outcome.\n",
      "a long-lived t-cell immune response develops in most infected immunocompetent persons and is responsible not only for recovery from infection but also for tissue pathologic changes.\n",
      "symptomatic reinfections are possible despite the presence of antibodies suggesting rapidly waning immune response or circulation of closely related but antigenically different viruses.\n",
      "t-cell immune response is involved in the clearance of virus and immunocompromised hosts may develop progressive and even lethal disease.\n",
      "it is known that sars-cov nsp1 protein increases cellular rna degradation and thus might facilitate sars-cov replication or block immune responses.\n",
      "the virus evades innate immune response defenses interferes with interferon production degrades cell mrnas and modulates ubiquitination pathway.\n",
      "in addition to the host immune response factors inherent to the virus may be central for pathogenicity such as the varying susceptibility of the hpiv f protein to cleavage by proteolytic enzymes present in infected tissues.\n",
      "the effect of sars-cov infection on the immune system is highlighted by pronounced t-cell lymphopenia and elevation of several inflammatory cytokines il-1 il-6 and il-12 and chemokines mcp-1 and ip-10 observed in patients.\n",
      "a deviation toward th2 cytokine response is associated with more severe disease whereas a th1 response leads to effective viral clearance and milder illness.\n",

      "both cellular and humoral arms of the acquired immune response are important in controlling mhv disease and recovery from infection.\n",
      "the full manifestations of acute mhv infection are usually interrupted by immune response or death in infants.\n",
      "organ specificity of b and t cells in host immune response to infection appears to also occur with enterotropic mhv.\n",
      "a number of studies have documented significant effects on immune responses of mhv-infected mice through both direct and indirect effects of the virus reviewed in barthold 1986 lindsey et al 1991 .\n",
      "in mice with disruption of the jhd locus absence of b cells and ig and syngeneic h-2d b cell-positive antibody-deficient mice it was found that the absence of b cells or antibody had no effect upon cd4 + or cd8 + t cell responses or virus clearance during acute mhv-jhm infection of the central nervous system .\n",
      "in addition viremic dissemination to the central nervous system is often seen in infant mice barthold and smith 1984 and immune-deficient strains of mice such as nude scid or rag null mutant mice figs 6-4 6-5 .\n",
      "conflicting results have been found with central nervous system infection with mhv-a59 in cd8 + t cell-deficient beta2 microglobulin null mutant mice which were able to clear acute central nervous system infection in most mice sutherland et al 1997 .\n",
      "thus caution is advised in generalizing about pathogenesis and host responses to mhv which are likely to be both virus and mouse strain-specific.\n",
      "mhv infection of the central nervous system represents a commonly used model system and mhv-jhm remains the most frequently utilized neurotropic strain for such studies.\n",
      "splenic t cell proliferative responses were depressed in mhv-jhm infected balb/cbyj a/jcr c3h/hesnj but not c57bl/6ncr mice .\n",
      "such results must be interpreted cautiously as b celldeficient b6.igh6 tmlcgm mice have impaired t cell responses to mhv-jhm .vaccination pathways are important in inducing efficient immune responses and different immunization routes may elicit different immune responses to the same protein antigens.\n",
      "s1 subunit for example is much shorter than the full-length s protein but it is no less able to induce strong immune responses and/or protection against viral infection adney et al 2019 .\n",
      "despite their ability to induce immune responses and/or neutralizing antibodies ntd and s2 as the targets of subunit vaccines are less immunogenic eliciting significantly lower antibody titers cellular immune responses and/or protection than the other regions such as full-length s1 and rbd jiaming et al 2017 .\n",
      "similarly some viral-vectored vaccines can elicit specific antibody and cellular immune responses with neutralizing activity and protection but they might also induce anti-vector immunity or present preexisting immunity causing some harmful immune responses.\n",
      "similar to dna or vlp-based vaccines subunit vaccines are generally safe without causing potential harmful immune responses making them promising vaccine candidates.\n",
      "adjuvants play an essential role in enhancing host immune responses to mers-cov subunit vaccines including those based on the rbd and different adjuvants can promote host immune responses to variant levels lan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 .\n",
