Alternatively if one were to use the homologous rbd from 2019-ncov itself this immune response would likely be very advantageous since it could yield both a blocking effect and a vaccination effect 52. Traditional vaccines rely on priming the immune system through exposure to viral proteins or peptides often derived from surface proteins that exhibit a high rate of mutation which increased the chances of viral evasion of the host immune response 44. In contrast here we have demonstrated a genetic strategy that is able to target highly conserved regions which would be expected to make it much more unlikely for the virus to escape inhibition through mutation. Several dna viruses were also identified and analyses of cdna shotgun metagenomics sequencing provided evidence of active replication for some. The host airway immune response was also evaluated significantly increased expression of immune response genes was detected in patients with confirmed lower respiratory tract pathogens.

But if the consequence of administration of such compounds is the augmentation of host responses to virus infection then the precise classification of these compounds as ifn inducers or immune enhancers as well as their detailed mechanisms of action are of secondary importance 9 8. Immune modulators immune modulators are substances which either stimulate or suppress one or more elements of the immune system. Immunosuppressive factors induced by viruses have already been discussed in section 6. About 40% of these noncoding rnas are similarly regulated during in vitro infection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with mouse-adapted influenza virus and by interferon treatment suggesting that these noncoding rnas may play a role in regulating the host response to virus infection particularly the innate immune response.
